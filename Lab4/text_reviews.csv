1,"As an experienced youth minister and religion teacher I found this book to be very inadequate. This isn't a book for adolescents on theology, it is a book with adolescent theology. It has not quite reached maturity. The answers show a lack of understanding by the author in basic moral and sacramental theology. The book is also selective in quoting the CCC. I will disagree with other reviews suggesting Mr. Pinto said aborted babies might go to hell, what he did do in that question was give the impression there is a limbo."
2,"I have read quite a few mushroom books in my course of book reviewing, but I would have to say this is one of the best. This book has great coverage on propagation, cultivation, identification and collecting. I like the decision to leave out mushrooms of unknown edibility because it makes the book much more manageable.The photography is excellent. I liked the addition of habitat shots of where certain mushrooms grow. This would surely help anyone who is a collector.This book stayed on track and didn't try to be all things to all people. For instance, in the cultivation section, they tell you what to read for more information depending on the type of mushroom.This book has great information on all levels and is helpful guide for the novice to expert gardener."
1,"I am a big fan of this children's story, so the movie was a major disappointment to me. I hated the changes that were made to the story, and I didn't care for the added violence. The story is a good one as is, and didn't need added movie violence. The changes that were made were not necessary and annoying."
2,I purchased this cookbook the year it was first published in 1972. I had just gotten married and needed some variety in my cooking. It covers everything - all sorts of ethnic recipes my family thought were delicious. I became an instant gourmet.
2,"This is a collection of the very first season of Monty Python's Flying Circus. Included in this boxed set are: Famous Deaths, Man with Three Buttocks, Flying Sheep, Nudge Nudge Wink Wink, Undressing in Public, Confuse-A-Cat, and Silly Job Interview and that's just the highlights!These comedy shows aired in Great Britain in 1969 and the humor holds up astonishingly well. These guys are just as odd now as they were when they first started and these comic riffs rely on universally funny things such as nudity, death, humiliation, insanity, TV programming, government and history. It's a bit like a medieval morality play gone wrong with young men dressing as old women. Really cheesy sets and totally un-special effects combine with inspired writing and timing to produce something that became a cult classic."
1,Had not read F S Fitzgerald previously and was expecting a better read. The character development was great but found the story line lacking and the whole of it bland in the end.
1,I have always loved V Tech phones. This one is cheap and I do mean cheap. The battery doesn't last even after being on the base all day. It is a great looking phone but I need to use it not just look at it.
1,Very boring. Bland new age techno without any redeeming qualities. An appropriate place for this to be played would be in an elevator or perhaps convalescence home.
1,"Never did the phrase 'one hit wonder' apply more than it does here. ""F**k It (I Don't Want You Back)"", is this album's only shining star. The rest of the tracks are just copy cats, with painfully poor lyrics & absolutely no fluent melodies or rhythms at all. The truly sad part is, Eamon shouldn't have to end his career after just one song. He actually has a nice singing voice, but the problem is he has way to much artistic freedom, which unfortunatley has been the downfall of many talented new artists. Had Jive only taken more interest & hired gifted producers & song writers, things might have been different. Say hello to 2004's Lumidee, but also remember to say a quick goodbye very shortly thereafter."
1,"Shame on me for thinking I had gotten a great deal when I ordered this case. Nowhere on the product description does it state that there is no plastic protection for the video screen - it's just a square hole in the metal case. Having always used a leather case, I just assumed ALL cases would have this added protection. While I know I could purchase separate plastic pieces to serve the purpose.........why should I have to? Don't waste your money. This is cheap, tacky, and a rip-off......even at less than $5.00."
2,"The third coming of the Foo Fighters is at hand! Be afraid, be very afraid. Although the album isn't going to be the end of the world, it is still excellent. With songs such as Live-in Skin, Breakout, and Stacked Actors rocking like old time Foo Fighters, you don't have to worry about a soft, and sappy album from the Foo Fighters. But there are still several soft songs, but in those songs (New Year, MIA, Ain't it the Life)the band still finds a way to make the song rock. With Dave Grohl's new and improved vocals, the Foo Fighters have returned with their most impressive album yet, with songs ripping through the walls with screams and tearing guitar and drum tracks and songs with pleasant melodies and beautiful vocals. Congratulations Dave, Nate, Taylor, and Chris, you have now made your mark as one of the top rock bands of the decade."
2,"I rented this movie on a snowy day along with several other films and was pleasantly surprised. I was looking for something light and fun and that is exactly what I got.Jason Biggs, who played the charming but goofy lead in American Pie, is Paul a guy who moves from the mid-west to New York City to go to College and is immeadiately overwhelmed by ""city"" life. His roomates are horrible and only add to his inability to fit in.In class Paul meets Dora, Mena Suvari - who was also in American Pie as well as American Beauty. As Paul gets to know Dora he begins to see that life in the big city is not all bad. Jason Biggs, Mena Suvari and Greg Kinnear were all good in this movie - the plot was not as strong as most of Amy Heckerling's past high school type comedy's such as Fast Time or Clueless but this film was still cute.Loser would make a cute date film or would be good when you are looking for something light."
1,"I agree with ""Huntsmen"". $600 for a bunch of dusty old Doctor Who eps? No way.For that kind of money, I would want THE ENTIRE SERIES on DVD. You can get 7 years of TNG for about that? Same for X-files."
1,"What is this? Some tracks taken from old records! They should put here some exclusives, all this tracks are available on records of those artist."
2,"I ordered this at the request of my husband. All I can say is it works, so we are happy with it. It did take a little longer to arrive than our Amazon orders typically do though."
2,This DVD comes out of Korea and has Korean subtitles that can be turned off by going to the DVD setup. The picture quality was quite good compared to the old VHS movie I use to have. For the price this is a good by. DVD cover art is in Korean and some English and might bother some people but if you look online you can find the cover art in English and download it for free same as the DVD label on the Disc.
1,"I am one person who did not like ""Does He Love You"", Reba's first duet with Linda Davis. Here we have another one and its even worse!!! The rest of the album is just more of Reba's pop stylings which have really gotten old!! I did enjoy ""Forever Love"" but I didn't like anything else on this."
1,"This filter is not, in my estimation, any good. It leaves a sediment , and the end product, the coffee, tastes terrible. Use paper filters insted for a great cup of coffee."
1,I bought this set opened every pack out of 36 packs not one Emmitt Smith rookie card it was a waste of 20 dollars
1,This product will not charge an ipod nano that was purchased this Christmas. The manufacturer's website is not accessible and their toll free number for customer service tells you to go to their website for help. This must be an old product that is not compatible to the new ipod's even though the product description says it is. Be aware of this if you are considering purchasing this product.
1,"Tap one of these the wrong way and it explodes. My petite 10-years old daughter shattered one by knocking on the counter---not dropping it, but just setting down a little roughly. After the 20 minutes it took me to clean up the shattered glass, I broke another one by dropping it less than two inches onto a coffee cup. And these two were just many in a long line of disastrous breaks we've experienced with these modern Duralex glasses that we've had for about two years now.The Duralex glasses that we got 21 years ago were great, but these new ones are nothing like the old."
1,"Really, Do not bother! A great film reproduced by a flim-flam DVD company. I was going to show this to my college students this evening. I don't even know if they could endure it. I certainly can't. Search for a used VHS copy. This hack job is terrible!"
2,"This 6-hour documentary offers a great range of perspectives on the Hurricane Katrina experience. While it builds useful context and explains many of the issues, some of the individuals who share commentary throughout seem overly extreme in their views; they share ""information"" that is interesting in that it informs their views, but is factually questionable. It would be hard to watch the whole thing straight through, but most viewers will find sections that answer their own questions about Hurricane Katrina. You'll almost certainly be left with more questions than you had when you started, but that's a good thing."
1,Item works but is much slower than anticipated. I will need to upgrade to a faster adapter.
2,"While not much is written about the Boxer Rebellion, Diana Preston, does a great job. I could not put this down, it reads like a novel. Preston vividly re counts the events leading up to the rebellion, as well as the conflict itself. The discription of the charaters in the same detailed light (the sexual habits of the players is also mentioned, but not over done)places a face on the conflict. It also descibes the awkward union of the world powers that sent troops to rescue the legations in Peking. What I noted the most is that in some aspects China has changed very little. The maps and pictures help with the story. I liked this book very much, and being an avid history reader I could not tell if this was a novel or a history book. If you are looking for a great read that covers this period (in which so few books are written) buy Preston's book."
1,"The out of the box MP 2003 templates for print and web publishing are excellent and easy enough to manage but trying to get them online is an absoltue nightmare. Files become corrupted easily and directories get run through the grinder, so by the time you're ready to bring up your web site online it's become an FTP rat's nest. I've worked w/ 3 major host services and none of us could get an MP2003 generated site to work w/ all indexes, images and text attached and/or pointed in the right direction. I would go w/ the free Nvu.com software for a more stable web site creation. Code layout is easier to follow."
2,This is a book for anyone who truly enjoys the art of children's poetry! I just found this today at a local used bookshop and fell in love with it as soon as I opened it. It will be a cherished volume in my growing collection of poetry. It is a collection of pure classics by the masters of verse and rhyme. I just wish I had owned this book when my children were young and at home!
2,"This is another masterpiece of Hans Zimmer. One of the reasons I loved the Last Samurai movie was the soundtrack. Indeed, it reflected what the story was about. It truly reflected the Japanese culture & marshal arts.My favorites themes are: A Way Of Life, Spectres In The Fog, Taken, A Hard Teacher, To Know My Enemy, Idyll's End, Safe Passage, Ronin, Red Warrior, The Way Of The Sword, A Small Measure Of Peace.Oops! Did I just mention ALL the themes? It seems so! Then all of them must have been awesome, and this means (Don't read all the reviews. Go & BUY THE SOUNDTRACK NOW!)Applaud to our German music Composer Mr. Zimmer!"
2,"This combination CD and phrasebook has been excellent in helping me with both my research for my third novel and for preparing to visit Morocco. Moroccan Arabic is not the same as the Arabic spoken in other countries and this product not only lets me put authenticity in my dialogue, it ALSO lets me communicate to shopkeepers and others while touring Morocco. I highly recommend it to anyone planning a trip to this beautiful country.Suzanne Arruda - Author of Mark of the Lion, and Stalking Death"
1,"The High Points: AlphabeticalThe Low Points: Articles, Factual Information, Overly Brief Synopsis of People... etc.Avoid unless you like reading the ""cliff notes"" of serial killers"
2,"My borther Daniel is a masseuse in NY. One of his clients is Mr. Terrence McNally. When the book was being written, Mr. McNally did my brother and my family a great honor - the central characters' last name was to be Lukowski. What can I say but thanks !"
1,"I purshased these to use with my iPod when out running. Quality is very good but there are some concerns:1: Moto states that battery will drain more quickly in time to the point where it must be replaced --However it is not possible to replace the battery so once it goes bad you must discard the 80$ ear phones(!)2.) Battery life is quite poor so expect to recharge them a couple of times daily.3.) If like me you are looking to have them when exercising, understand that they are very sensitive to interference and will often cut the sound. I have my iPod attached to my upper arm just less than a feet from my ears and I still have problems. Having it in your jeans pockets or even in your chest pocket is a big no-no: You either hold it in your hand or you put it on your upper arm: obviously this does not deliver the benefits of going cordless..."
2,I was very pleased with this product. The skewers are durable and easy to clean. Overall a great buy.
2,This is a nice book for morning and evening prayers. It has a beautiful cover and is the right size to pit into a purse or bag to take on the go. This is a perfect book to start praying the Liturgy Of The Hours.
2,"songs are not written like this anymore. we all should be thankfull that our old snap, crackle and pop albums are being released as cd's now.lm"
1,"The author writes well, but nothing he says is so profound or comforting. In fact, at times it felt kind of insincere and glib, like he was using other people's sorrows (including his own family's) to make himself appear deep. I agree with the comment's of the other reviewer: Naomi Levy's To Begin Again is by far more helpful, the only one that belongs in the class of When Bad Things Happen To Good People."
1,"DeLonghi DCH1030 Ceramic HeaterDON""T BUY THIS SPACE HEATER !!! UNLESS, you don't mind partial outages throughout your house. It's just too STRONG and it tripped over and over parts of our home - EEHHHHH EVEN THE TVs and the PC!!! Finally had to call an electricn, and we all know how expensive THEY can be. But, he asked if we had AHY new electirical things in the house. We didn't even THINK of the space heater. The electican just happened to see the space heater on the floor by my PC (COOL AREA< HERE) and immediately picked it up. Sure enough, it was a 1500W. IT WAS THE CULPRIT !! I have run other 1500W space heaters, but there is JUST SOMETHING about this little lemon. Cost us $89 for the electrican (cheap around here). You are warned !!!!"
1,"I am a big fan of some of Revell's other work, and I usually enjoy the comic/superhero scores, so I paid close attention to the music while watching the movie. Alongside the film, I thought the score provided a pretty good complement for several key scenes, but unfortunately, I didn't find this score very entertaining after listening to it by itself. Most of the tracks seem uninspired and a little slow, and the overall score seems to be so overwhelmed with dark, brooding, mysterious qualities that it never really identifies the essence of the Daredevil character or a good movie theme. I was disappointed."
2,"Many details in book which should be combined with""First Manassas Battlefield Map Study"" by Edwin C Bearsson sale at Amazon for $30 (map study book and maps).Combine the two and you've got a real winner!"
2,"What a great read! Full Circle is the story of how friends and families intertwine as decades pass. The characters are so real and are all flawed in some way, such as in life. I am a big fan of Ms. Young's books and feel this is her best effort to date. Her novels are thought provoking and so complex. Don't start this one at bed time!"
2,The Rebel follows Melinda Metz's wonderful ability to keep the reader hooked. One problem is solved and another begins for the teens.The Rebel is my personal favorite thus far in the series. The eerie presence of the collective consciousness and the struggle between environment versus biological ties were truly mastered.I would reccomend this series to anyone from 12-60. It definitely leaves you wanting more!
1,"I bought this game for my 5 year old son to play on his DS Lite. He had gotten Super Mario Bros. and loved it so I thought Mario Kart would be the next logical game in the succession. It is a little harder for him to play so for those who are novices with the DS or very young like he is, expect some frustration. But for those who have a good handle on game play it falls in line with the rest of the classic Super Mario games."
2,"Who would have guessed that Leon Redbone, that fedora and dark glasses-wearing blues anachronism, was capable of producing such a sweet and charming Christmas album? Not I, that's for sure. Yet, here it is, making a fine addition to anyone's holiday music collection.Ably assisted by Dr. John, Terry Waldo and a trio of lovely violins, Leon handles the usual group of standards, a couple of rarities and one new original (That Old Christmas Moon) with style and aplomb. His White Christmas, with those violins gently wafting in the background, is enough to melt the iciest of hearts and the Dr. John duet on Frosty the Snowman is fun and marvelously infectious.At under thirty minutes in length, the disc may feel a bit sparse, but it never overstays it's welcome and offers a nice alternative to the overproduced, mass marketed product that poses as Christmas music these days."
1,"These are smaller than before and are now tapered, which makes them dome shaped and creates annoying bulges in your bra cup that will show through your shirt. The old Lansinoh pads were perfection for us bigger-breasted women, but now, with the smaller size, they are just as inferior as every other brand!"
2,"Enrique's Journey is a powerful story of the human cost of economic disparity in the Americas and our failure to find a humane way to accommodate the many workers who come to the U.S. to take jobs most Americans will not accept. Nazario's writing is superb and well-paced, gripping the reader and introducing a world that is unknown to most of us, yet whose effects are all around us."
2,"if you love the chants, these are the complete bottom line for male voices and that deep real spirtual experience"
1,"I have to agree with another review that didn't like the heroine. She was spoilt, selfish, too self absorbed, a smoker ....need i go on? I love Nora Roberts, but this book was just too slow i was skipping pages! Thus the 2 stars!Like another review, i am so looking forward to reading Kate's and Laura's stories b'se they seem much more interesting. Ugh! This Margo! So stuck up!"
1,I did not think the supersmile was worth the money. It did not get my teeth cleaned as I followed the directions recommended.
1,"Unless you like systems that get damaged right out of the box, due to dead pixels, don't buy this thing. it is just too fragile to be a useful gaming system. Either buy something more durable, like the DS, or save your money for the next gen consoles. Pick either ps3, xbox360, or N Revolution. Your choice, of course, just make sure you stay away from the PSP. It's not worth the $$$"
2,"Worked great, great price. Enables my boys( ages 11 & 7) to take a shower by themselves without making water go everywhere chasing down the escaped showerhead."
1,"This tub is what I thought would be perfect for my baby. I sure wish I had read the reviews on this product before I bought it! I have the same problem with this tub leaking all over the place! The drain plug on mine is SUPER hard to snap into place as well as pushing the buttons down to get the tub to go into its smaller position! I still haven't been able to get it into that position yet! I'm going to try and take it back, as I have already bought a new one!"
2,"Came as promised, but the key light was burned out. No big deal, the product rocks."
1,"Just as other purchasers have warned, this chip failed after taking about 250 pictures while I was on vacation. The chip froze up and the camera won't function with it, nor can I download the pictures. There is a manufacturer's flaw in this product. I have now purchased another brand. Don't use this chip for a camera or you will lose your pictures. I wish that I could get a refund rather than a replacement chip on the warranty."
1,Respecting Oracle Press I bought this book... :( NEVER AGAIN! Why don't they clearly write on the outside that this is a word-for-word copy of the DBA 8i Certification Guide? Makes you realize the pitfalls of online buying!!!
1,"Although at first glance this strainer appears well-made, the handle broke off the first time I used it. I was using it to make gravy and don't think I put undue strain on it. Amazon was great and there was no problem returning it for a full refund with prepaid return shipping, but I will be looking for a better made strainer. This food strainer is not worth the price."
1,"After about six months the phone would no longer charge. After calling customer service I was instructed to mail it to them in a very specific way that cost me about twelve dollars. I was told 14 days was the longest they would keep the phone. After 21 days and countless hours on the phone during which time they could never find the phone they overnighted me back the phone untouched in a flimsy paper mailer and told me that it had water damage. The phone had no water damage, they simply never entered the phone in their system, did not want to do what they were supposed to do and overnighted it back to me to save themselves. Please think long and hard before purchasing anything from Motorola they will not support their warranty."
2,"I had no intention of seeing the movie because I could not stand the bubble-gum music of Abba. The video store was out of everything I wanted to see so I rented the movie so I could see what my coworkers were raving about. Well, it did have Streep and I'd watch Brosnan peel potatoes all day...he is yummy! What I didn't count on was how good the movie was and I'm very distressed to see that I find myself singing the songs and even buying the DVD. Abba? Julie Waters' version of ""Take a chance"" is wonderful and Streep's ""Winner takes it all"" made me cry. Granted, Brosnan's singing is a tad painful but it was passable. I loved the movie and now I'm a fan. I wish they had a package that had both the DVD and the CD soundtrack of the movie bundled."
1,"Don't waste your money. This book was useless. I just returned from my trip on Route 66 and never once found this book useful. I suggest Route 66 Adventure Handbook, by Knowles and highly recommend Traveling Route 66, by Freeth. The last a great traveling companion helps figure out mileage and what to see."
2,I just keep buying these cd's for the wife she really seems to love them. You should all try this one out.
2,"This is much better built than the adapter that came with my BP200. I was able to fix the original adapter though, so I plan on using the new one outside of my house. The new version doesn't get as warm as the old one after several hours of use. Using thicker wire helps with that.I found it at a great price, so I opted for the expedited delivery to get the thing on my hands quickly."
2,"I ordered this to protect me from the sun at the beach. I had no idea what a ""rash guard"" was. I usually wear size M or L in a polo. I wanted tee shirt fit, so at vendor's suggestion I ordered XXL. Quality is great, but with a 39 inch gut this isn't for me; I'll return it. Wife says I look like a stuffed sausage. Wish I had great abs!"
1,"I was disappointed with this rooibus tea, which is ordinarily one of my favorite teas. It doesn't compare with Numi or Twinings rooibus for fresh flavor, color and aroma. A poor substitute for those brands."
2,This movie gives you good insight into how close the US and USSR came to nuclear war. I'm sure glad that cooler heads prevailed.
2,"I don't understand all the down voting from fans just because it's not the ""super duper uber version with so many extras you'll crap your pants!"" GROW UP! Wait on the version you want, whining and down voting a great Bluray set achieves nothing. Anyway, this collection is ALL of the films on Bluray with a few extra features that have been available for a while. So if you're like me and never got around to buying the films on DVD and could care less about all the bells and whistles, this is a GREAT collection and well worth the money.Edit:Well this WAS well worth the money when it was $69.99 now that it's $112.39 it's not."
2,"I previewed my dvd saturday night. This morning, after feeding my 11 week old at 5 am, I started the workout. Shellie does a great job at a good pace. This post-natal incorporates Taebo moves at a pace suitable for new mommies. I tried doing my old Taebo tapes but found it hard to keep up. This video is a great start to getting back to Taebo advance status. Thanks Shellie! See you again in the morning."
1,"I chose this rating because, the box was open and the bags appeared to be used. I will not order this product again."
2,"After hearing some audio of Dr. Russell, I purchased his book and found it very relative to Bible endeavors. Without criticizing or comparing him to others, I found it very insightful. If you read this Mr. Russell, thanks-Mike"
1,"I loved their other things, but Althalus seems like it was written by a 14 year old boy. Every single thing out of the characters mouth is supposed to be witty, funny, clever, or outright hilarious... which equals a character that is as deep as the page it's written on. I honestly don't know how anyone takes this seriously! Its just not that funny, and tries way too hard. The only reason it was even published as a book suitable for grownups is because the Eddings' have a great track record, and their name sells, even if the plot is about as complicated as ""Bad god wants to unmake the world and good god wants to stop him"" can get. Every person they come across is either helpful and friendly and clever, or wicked and clever. And it's immediately obvious which is which. I mean, really people? Terry put it so eloquently... Wizards First Rule, you know."
1,Cheked on Amazon and it looks ok. Ordered and received promtly. Opened it up and found out it is too small for adult use.
1,"What a pity that so talented a writer reaches so deep into his imagination and comes up with only crumbs of credible narrative. Technologically and militarily,it's typical,excellent Joe Buff,but the scenario is in every sense unbelievable and, thus, the reader tends to become increasingly cynical as the story develops.6 million casualties in a month in this war, with huge physical damage to all combatant countries and our heroes are reacting and responding to it all as if it were just another PacFleet exercise. Give us a break,Joe."
1,"When I received this product and loaded the software, it was immediately apparent that it was user unfriendly on my Vista Home 32 bit system. Even after I went to D-Link's web site and was able to find drivers for the unit, it slowed the entire system and began displaying cannot find file windows every time I booted up my computer. Now I have to return the device to the Amazon Retailer at my expense. I bought a D-link draft n interface for my computer in hopes that it would be transformed into one that matches the currently good performance of my d-link draft n 655 router. Save your money until you can get a computer with a draft n card. At least then you probably wont notice that you are only getting .g speed."
2,"It was a great movie to buy my new Girlfriend. I like the cute romance, and is a good coming out to mom/family story. I'd watch it again, only with new ppl that havent seen it. Not a Favorite of all times movie, but a pretty good womyns movie."
2,A thrilling book and an inspiration to all those who love competition and always try to improve themselves not only in sports but in every aspect of their lives.
1,"The graphics are great but the limited track and repetitive route lead to a quick loss in interest. The great graphics and driving ""feeling"" are soon not enough to hold your interest. Also, there is no option to steer with either the thumb controller or the arrow pad, you are forced to the thumb controller which I do not prefer."
1,I find it oddly interesting that the five star reviews of this very expensive book all sound like they were done by the same person....or it is just me?
2,"My local ""blue and yellow"" big name electronics store (which I do love) does alright on most pricing, but fails miserably when it comes to high-end a/v cables. Best off-brand PS3 HDMI cable price? $[...]. Yikes! This $[...] cable is plenty long enough and delivers excellent video performance for both gaming and blu-ray movies. I'm using it with the Oppo Digital HM-31 HDMI switch as my TV has only one HDMI input. Highly recommend both products (available right here on Amazon!)"
2,"I have all three seasons of ""Deadwood"" and love it. This is a very well written and acted series. I wish HBO would have finished the series. It was left hanging at the end of the third season. Still, well worth watching."
1,"This device is too complicated. After you set the alarm, you have to remember that this is not the same as turning the alarm on, so you have to hit another button. You also have to remember that hitting the OFF/RESET button on the top of the clock just turns off the alarm for that day. The alarm will go off the next morning unless you hit another button. This is especially annoying when the alarm goes off at 6 AM on a Saturday. The nature sounds are repetitive and irritating with the possible exception of the ocean. The mechanism of the CD player is noisy, making it difficult to listen to low-level music to sleep by. While the display is backlit, the controls are not, so it's difficult to turn things on and off in the dark. I would not buy another one of these."
1,"Terrible from start to... middle. I only lasted about 40 minutes before giving up in absolute disgust.Culturally ignorant, CHEAP, vapid, crass and utterly declasse. This ""film"" transforms what was once an audaciously intelligent and sassy series into a revolting caricature. So bad is it that I won't squander precious words in attempting to describe the repellant nature of it all.In short....UGH!"
1,"I bought this product as a deal of the day 3 weeks ago,I just got around to trying it today,and I was very disappointed to find out it does'nt work,its loud and it does'nt vacuum at all.I hope I have good luck with customer service. I""ll call monday.I think I""ll stick to buying appliances locally."
2,It is very durable and compact. Could have been just a little bit bigger to store extra battery and memory card.
1,"So, appears the PC gestapo has learned to write and publish books. What we have here is someones interpertation of what Punk is to them. In No way is any of the music a focal point, inwhich it takes a back seat to a political message which only ends with ones personal gain. This book should of stayed a 6 page pamplet you quickly throw away ( one like christian organizations hand out, hint hint). This book does no good for punk and people who consider is a main part of there lives."
1,"Ive been waiting forever for Twisted Metal so i was looing for some kind of racing shoot'em up destruction... you know what im saying, but this game bites. No wonder i had never heard of it. Dont waste your time, as im not wasting another minute writing this review."
1,"Could not read past the first five pages. How Tolle attempted to include Jesus in his introduction as though that somehow made his teachings endorsed by His word, was obvious to any Christian who knows the Bible, this was outright slander. Clear to me this was a New Wave book and this was the beginning of the end of my trust in Oprah's judgement. I'm broken hearted because this women chose to believe a concept that makes her equal to God instead of taking the time to learn what her upbringing tried to tell her; the Bible is where she can find all her answers. Oprah proclaims to be so openminded yet she took one phrase from the Bible out of context, and neglected to do the research on her reaction, as she so dearly proclaims is neccessary to any endorsement she gives."
2,Had this CD years ago and it was stolen from my car along with all other music. The CCM being played today can't hold a candle to this beautiful musical offering. Clay Crosse is amazing.
1,"I am very dissapointed. The glass feeder broke when I was attaching it to the plastic base, after pouring the liquid. The neck of the glass bottle broke and it wasn't because of a tight turn, since never finishing turning it. It might have been a defective issue. Since I don't want to pay for returning fees, I just lost my money with this item!"
2,If you enjoy learning about the characters of the Old West you'll really enjoy this book! I'd recommend keeping this book for future generations.
1,I paid 29.99 and it broke as I showed it to my daughter on Christmas. The draw bridge does not stay closed and does not open if you push the lever. The piece that snaps on the front so the pony can walk over the water does not stay on. The castle is suppose to snap and fold shut... mine does not. And the crown is junk! It does not stay together. My stickers are falling off after 2 days. I will try glue for the stickers. And I really feel that toysrus should refund my money.
2,"wonderful movie very authentic as for the clothing and settings, was great at keeping my attention. actors were superb! recommend it to anyone that is into period movies."
2,A DVD that every woman should watch - high school and older. This can be used by book clubs in conjunction with the book. Excellent film.
1,"This is possibly the worst self-cleaning litter box I have ever seen. I decided to buy one about 4 years ago and 2 weeks after getting it, the rake started getting stuck and making this loud clicking noise. After a few weeks, I got fed up with it and decided to give it go, and bought a new one. It did the exact same thing. I now own a Litter Maid, and so far it has worked out."
2,"I'm a sucker for the tales with a twist (think Wicked -- made me feel sorry for the Wicked Witch). I had watched a show mid-season and thought it was ""okay"" - but my son insisted that I watch from the pilot all the way through the first season. What a difference! Clever writing, to get all of these characters intertwined in a cohesive storyline. And the costumes are incredible!! I'd watch this show just to see the costumes. The person who makes them is a genius -- wish I could find a place to buy one for a costume party (which I would throw JUST to wear the costume). Can't wait until Season Two is out."
2,"This book of poetry covers some very heavy stuff. At the same time, the subject matters cover a lot of matters that I've wanted to read for a while.I suggest that you do not read his poetry silently. Say it all out loud! They're meant to be read loud and proud. Trust me, that's worth it."
1,"This band's awesome ""Breakbeat Science Excercise 6"" is what encouraged me to buy this disc. I love the artwork on the disc itself. However, I live continous DnB mixes, and this had segregated songs. You can tell the duo is trying to branch into new genres, or at least not do just typical DnB. However, since I was in a pure DnB mood with them, I was disappointed. Don't get me wrong: I don't hate this disc. It just wasn't heavenly like J. Magik or ""Safari"" by Bad Company or many Diesel Boy discs. There are some tracks that keep it true to the genre. Those were great."
1,I can't put it into words to describe this record. The guitar lines need a little more something and mixed too loud. Mabey we could hear the rest of the band instead of somebodys ego.
1,"My 11-year-old son brought this book home from the grade school library and, upon first glance, I thought it would be an interesting book. However, as I flipped through the book and saw the newspaper clippings the other reviewers mentioned, I was somewhat startled. Some of them read: ""Japan Admits WWII Use of Sex Slaves,"" ""War Protester Burns Herself To Death Here,"" and ""Newborn Found in Dumpster."" There were several other, similar articles. This may be fine for young adults of junior high age or higher, but not for grade school kids."
1,Another terrible release. Nothing new from the other DVDs. All the moves are similar to what she has already taught.
2,"This gives a slightly better signal than my old rabbit ears. I give it 5 stars because the signal is maintained consistently with all the channels I receive. I can't get any more channels than I got before, but the same channels all have a stronger signal and I don't need to do any adjusting if I change the channel. I recommend this for those who do not have high expectations but just want a slightly better signal. For the price it is definitely worth it.ADDITION: It turns out that I do get one channel that I didn't get before."
1,"Not gonna go into detail. If you're interested in this, you most likely are familiar with the show. The show itself is great, but the cuts they've made are very frustrating for fans. I just wanted to lend my voice to this."
1,"I bought one of these ""BonJour"" models thinking I was getting the same thing as those I used while studying in Italy. The quality of these asian knockoffs are nowhere near that of the real thing (aside from the rough manufacture, the steam pressure valve broke on mine after three uses, making it useless.)- Check out the Bialetti models on other Amazon pages. World Market also carries a real Italian model from another maker."
1,"Having listened to all the various 'incarnations' of the band, and appreciated all they've offered over the years, I'm at loss with this one. The songs feel incomplete, and at times, amateurish. While never a lyrical dynamo, Holmes lyrics on this album are probably some of his least creative, or imaginative yet. Not to mention repetitive and bordering on adolescent angst.One is left feeling like there was no real effort put forth, no feeling, or emotion on this album. The only thing this release has served to do is make me appreciate their other albums even more. The band is capable of much more than this.If the goal was to wallow in mediocrity, like so many of their imitators, congratulations. Mission accomplished."
2,"Watch is great!, very simple to set up and very functional! A must buy! And i was never a fan of watches until i bought this one!"
2,"This watch is cute and easy to use. Have dropped and banged it and still works great. Swim, ride and run with it. Wish i could find different bands to have variety."
1,"...after only a single recommended dose. Why? I experienced hypertension, dizziness, intense sweating, and other transient shock symptoms. In addition, the type on the label is VERY small, even under rather ordinary magnification. QED: check the ingredients and proceed with care and caution. If at all."
2,"First off, let me say that I don't usually read romance novels and this is the first of Katie MacAlister's books that I have read. I enjoyed it. The main character was relatable and I loved the opening scene in which Joy and her bff were having their fortunes told by their Wiccan friend. It seems that MacAlister has done her research; the parts dealing with occult seemed accurate. The love scenes were *hot* and MacAlister kept em coming (no pun intended) every 75 pages or so. Now, I do think this book fits the bill but we must keep in mind that it is a ROMANCE NOVEL. Sure, some of the dialogue was a bit cheesy at times, but most of it was witty and well written. Sure, the main character meets her soul mate the very first day of her vacation (don't we all?) Great American literature it is not but for what it is, it's well done and I'd read it again. (Actually, certain parts have already been reread--wink, wink!) ;) Buy it, you won't regret it."
1,"Ok, before I become a noob in the eyes of many, this is MY opinion. Listen or do not. My first experience seemed hopeful. I got into a good group, and played for a bit. Then things went down hill. The quests (missions in SGW) are boring and repetitive, and don't think about your levels. You will be tricked into attacking nests full of powerful beasts, or sent to deliver a package halfway across a planet. Most people hang out in taverns, bars, and cantinas, and do not actually embark on missions. Furthermore, it takes a excruciatingly long time to actually gain new skills or master a class, and most of the classes are unfun (a entertainer's sole job is to hit a key which caused him/her to dance on screen), or require endless monster kills to gain a single small bonus. For a newbie, this game is hell. For a casual gamer, it is frustrating. For a powergamer, it can be occasionally rewarding"
1,"This book is a sure snooze-fest. Luckily for me I did not have to read the entire book for my undergrad art history photo class. We read selected chapters of the book.They writing was horrible. Many parts were unclear. I had to reread what I read over and over. I can't stand this style of writing. Barthes attempts to come off as interesting and intelligent. Instead, he comes off as boring and pretentious.Skip this book... try something else."
1,"The only way this would work well is if you're already good at finding studs. There a very little magnet that will attach when over a metal piece of the wall, such as a nail or screw. And it doesn't always give you a solid hold. Basicly a fridge magnet would do the same thing."
2,This book is the most organized book on TA around. This is definitely a must read if you are serious about TA
2,"... Awesome party music! The guitar solo on track 5 absolutely shreds.No ... Seriously, this is (to use a generic word) ""beautiful"" music, but not cheesy like that Yanni cd they play at the local Starbucks.Relective music, slightly sad, good for thinking back on a long lost love or childhood. Very relaxing, probably adds years to your life just by listening to it."
2,"Ann Coulter has some interesting points to make. She also appears to be a meticulous researcher. To the detriment of her message is her shrill, invective-laden style. If she intends preaching to already existing believers, that's one thing I guess. But if she hopes to educate and perhaps convert those who don't already share her views, she has no more hope than Al Franken and Michael Moore who share Coulter's savage style. Except Franken and Moore are given more to twisting facts and outright lying.Overall, if you sort of hold your nose while reading this to filter out the stink of Coulter's bile, Treason is an informative read.Jerry"
1,"It's as if the movie was done by weird, immature teenagers. Honestly. The jokes are either cruel and just not funny. The plot is lame, dumb, and flat. The story happens in just, hmm, three places. The new characters feel flat, the original characters now feel flat also. Well, I can honestly say that neither parents nor children (at least those with a slightly sophisticated sense of humor) will be entertained by this."
2,This book is great for anyone on the weight watchers program. It's informative and motivational. It provides the guidance you get at the meetings in the privacy of your own home. I would recommend it to anyone.
1,"This had to be one of the worst Wrestlemanias I've seen in years. The only matches worth seeing are Randy Orton vs. CM Punk, Undertaker vs. HHH and maybe Edge vs. Del Rio.Snookie gets screen time and Daniel Brian doesn't? Really? Drew Carey is inducted into the Hall of Fame? Really? They might as well induct David Arquette while they're it.I'm a huge Rock fan but I don't think he really brought anything stellar into this PPV.Many of the segments such as the one with Snoop Dogg were just plain cheesy and atrocious. I can't believe I spent over 60 dollars on this travesty."
1,"The gore in this movie was impressive. However, that's where the greatness ends. There are so many holes in the plot that it appears that the writer just tacked on an ending, like ""hey, this might be neat"". There isn't much that leads up to the ending that could ever lead one to guess it. That's not in a good way either. There's a big difference between a surprise ending and an ending that just doesn't add up. One of many inconsistancies: if she wasn't in the car chasing the van, then she wasn't in the wreck that insued. If she wasn't in the wreck, then she wouldn't have any visible signs of being in a wreck. The plot could have been something great, if they would have followed through. But, it just wasn't."

I like her equal with Annabell. I think you should buy it! I got it saving 19.00!Bye!"
1,"I originally thought that this book would do a better job of addressing the needs of Internet entrepreneurs (emphasis on the word ""Internet""), but it's just another book on business plan writing; the only difference is that "".com"" has been added to boost sales. As a business planning book, it's not that it's a bad book, per se, it's just not an extraordinary one.For starters, it's not 240 pages, as advertised; it's only 190. And of that 190, almost a third is the same list of resources and references that every other book provides. Does the entrepreneur really need to be told ad nauseam that the SBA is a good source of information? And I was really shocked to see that addressing the technology related to running an Internet business was covered in less than one full page.The bottom line is that if you don't already own a business plan book, this is as good as any other. If you already have such a book, save yourself [the money] and skip this one."
1,"I found out about this book in some magazine (I only read Source, Vibe, Underlined Magazine, Essence, and the magazine with Vivica Foxx and 50 Cent on the cover this month) and I had to go to the bookstore to grab it. Photos like people on the El, Vin Diesel, Crazy Legs, and newspaper outfits make me miss my childhood (minus Vin Diesel, although he's just great eye candy). A few photos seem plain or typical (ex. Treach's photos, the everfamous middle finger shot, and the soccer photos), some were enjoyable for no apparent reason (Spencer 97 Pro Skater, man on bike in South Bronx), and others were completely unique (Usher, Naomi 03 in Da Studio, Karlene & Cindy, ""Do Not""). Overall I enjoyed the book."
1,I bought this solar light to use at night to save on electricity. I was very disappointed. The light was very dim despite being left in the full sun all day and the charge didn't last more than an hour. I'll keep it to use in a small room like the bathroom and I'll save the charge by only turning it on when I need the bathroom lit.
2,"very handy.pro:1. reasonably priced and works very well. sure is powerful.2. because the shaft base is plastic, used it right in the non-stick pots and not worry about damaging the bottom of the pot.con:1. don't drop the plastic chopper container. it can break/crack."
1,"This is the book is pretty weak by Hiaasen's standards. I have read ""Double Whammy"", ""Tourist Season"", & ""Stormy Weather"", and this book stands below them. While Hiaasen excels in satire, and in both outlandish characters and stories, this book stretches that limit, and creates both characters and a story that are so absurd that it drags on and on. In his other books the central character at least has a semblance of normality to them that makes them easy to relate to, and keeps you interested in the story and how events unfold. In Lucky You, all of the characters lives are the extreme, and while events are amusing it goes overboard to the point that you lose interest. I have found myself putting this book down several times. The only thing that has me picking it back up, is that I have been a fan of Hiaasen's other books. So unless you're a diehard fan of Hiaasen's, I would suggest you skip this one, and move on to another book."
2,"Tcl (Tool command language) scripting language.TK (tool Kit) graphic tool to help build graphic interface.You will be surprised to know that you know a lot of the commands and concepts already.The reason for different languages is to be more efficient in the purpose of the program. In my case, this is used for writing code for phone switching systems. No one can remember all the commands; so it is wise to carry your pocket reference with you. For those that do not have the occasion to use Tcl/Tk the reference helps you stay culturally literate. Moreover, who know one day you may have the need and say, ""now where did I put that Pocket reference?"""
1,I wish I'd read some of the other reviews posted here before buying the book. I even had many problems installing the CD-rom that came with the book; Arrrrrrrrghhhh..... I'm so annoyed... Please no one else buy this book. It's no good.
2,"like this heater very very much.I would recommend this product to everyone,very low oder ,disperts plenty of air flow .great heater.thinkin about ordering 2 more dont know????"
2,Any music by this guy is good - be sure to pick up his other cds as well as this one. It's enchanting and haunting and wonderfully executed.
2,"Well, it is not a ""Hollywood"" production....but I've enjoyed the History of purim, and I was able to pass it on to others to enjoy it.satisfied customer :)"
1,"Really pretty pictures, nice recommendations of possible plants to grow up the trellises, etc., but unless your a master carpenter, or able to use pictures, you'll never build any of them!! There's no diagrams or plans in the entire book!!"
2,"Rather than analyze this and thoroughly pick it apart piece by piece, I'll just say I thoroughly enjoyed it and leave it at that.But I think the hours the horses had to stand around having these peculiar pink creatures fuss over them and get them to do things they didn't understand merits at least a mention in the credits of the name of the warhorse and his raven haired sidekick. After all, without them, there wouldn't have been a movie."
1,I had heard a particular Stray Cats song on the radio. I was disappointed to find that the version of the song on the CD was not the same version that I had heard on the radio. I wish there had been a way to hear the songs or bits of the songs before I purchased the CDThe Very Best Of The Stray Cats: Rumble in Brixton
1,"I loved Bacheolo's art in this book. Really good stuff. Again Millar's poor writing of villains shows. Proteus just didn't have an ""umph"" behind him. Though he did get in his required body count (is it just me or do villains now aday have to kill like 300+ people an issue? Is it like a requirement to get their villain's license?). I will give Millar points for having Proteus being Xavier's son.Still, over all, I wasn't as impressed with this book as I was Tomorrow People or even Return to Weapon-X. I think Millar is running out of steam. If you want a good telling of the Proteus Saga go pick up the original Claremont/Byrne one, it's worth it."
2,"Ever since reading Colleen McCullough's book, Thr Thorn Birds, I have been interested in Australia and the people. I am so happy I came across Di Morrissey's book Tears of the Moon. The story held my interst as it paralelled the lives of men and women involved in the pearling industry and a more modern woman trying to learn about her past. Unfortunaty, this is the only book that Morrissey has published in this country. Through a member of an onlinen service I was able to purhcase and have sent fiver of her other titles from Australia. I am currently reading one of them now and enjoying it just as much as this one."
2,"Have used this ""tow-behind"" spreader three times now and have nothing but praise for it. Solidly made and adequately braced for the weight it is capable of handling. A well designed, wide enough stance on generously sized tires to prevent tip-overs even when going across steep grades. I use it behind our John Deere lawn tractor which is one of the 4 wheel-steer models which turns very sharp and the spreader tow bar is long enough to prevent contact with the rear of the tractor on the sharpest turns yet the on/off handle is still operator accessible while driving. The on/off handle is a direct mechanical connection to the drop gate on the bottom of the material hopper so it always functions unlike the poorly designed cable connectors you encounter on many other spreaders that give you headaches. Would have no problem recommending this spreader to friends and family.Agri-Fab 175-Pound Tow Broadcast Spreader 45-0329"
2,"This book provides a great analysis of the corruption of the financial markets during the 1990s and up to the market crash in 2001 with some Enron and World Com aftermath. The reader will be able to understand the derivative problems of the early 1990s and will see that those problems are potentially only a footnote compared to the risk and corruption in the financial markets today because of the use of complex derivatives. It is important to read this book if you want to understand the problems with financial markets, fund managers and regulators in order to protect your investments and understand where the economy is heading in the future."
2,This is a wonderful book that kept me captivated from beginning to end. I cannot wait to read the rest of the series and see what happens to the characters.
1,Just say that this cooler is crap. The first day just cooled and the second day and did not work. It is pure garbage. Do not waste your money on this piece of junk.
2,I FIRST LISTENED TO THIS AND I WASN'T ALL CHEERS. I PUT IT DOWN ONLY TO PICK IT UP AND PLAY IT AGAIN. IT CLICKED. AND I WAS SOON SINGING ALONG RIGHT IN STEP. A FINE RELEASE BY THE ROCKERS FROM BELGIUM.
2,"I've joined InVeStworks, the system that evolved from the theories set forth in this book. Read this book and learn how to use all that is good about network marketing companies and leave the craziness behind. You can really start for $1 a day ($30 a month)! Plus, you can integrate the network companies you already work with, leverage your involvement, create passive income and build good karma all the while."
2,A funky bass sound with Dave Weckl's drum technique.....Wonderful music that you have to listen.
1,Typical boring Hollywood shoot 'em up. One dimensional characters with big guns. Each scene is a repeat of the previous.
1,"I had hoped that this book would be as good as ""Thank You for Smoking."" It does start out promising, but the plot is very one-note and ultimately the book is pretty dull. Read ""Basket Case"" by Carl Hiaasen (or most any of his other books) instead. Far more enjoyable."
2,"This book is not intimidating but it is still very worthwhile, and if you are interested in this subject it would make a wonderful addition to your own library, and for this price it is hard to make a case against owning it.The short biographies about the legends in astronomy are interesting and many of the pictures are exquisite. The other reviewers have done an excellent job of describing the contents and layout."
1,The fuel line was a BLACK RUBBER hose not CLEAR as advertised by the seller. The picture of the product shows it as clear/yellowish and the description says Arnold GL-024 Clear Gas Line 2-Feet x 1/4-Inch ID. If I didn't need it so bad it would have gone back.
1,This may be a sharpener but for what I'm not sure. It is rough like a file but not big enough to sharpen an axe in any hurry. It is way too rough for making a sharp edge on a knife
1,"After reading the reviews on this tripe about exceptional men raised by maverick moms, I'll offer that when it comes to statistical data, single mothers acting alone are the largest group of perpetrators of abuse of children than any other group. And this you'll find in the book, ""The Diary of a Patient Man, A Father's Struggle.""The Diary of a Patient Man, A Father's Struggleand the data as I found comes from research conducted across several states, and several hundreds of thousands of victims each year. As a father of an exceptional little girl, I won't be wasting my money on this book. But, if you are an exceptional mother, you might order the book above to see how mavericks sociopath mothers abuse men and children."
1,"The instructor is high energy and likeable, but the actual instruction is very poor. She confuses left and right and rushes through each section without good explanation of the steps. For example, the cha-cha step is not explained, just ""do a triple"". Also, I have taken Latin ballroom dance, and I felt like this video just threw a bunch of Spanish dance words in without consideration for the actual form. For example, the salsa segment never tells you that the salsa count is 1, 2, 3 (hold), 5, 6, 7 (hold). And then cha-cha steps are thrown in to the salsa segment. Messed up.This might be a fun aerobics DVD for someone who didn't care about actual dance moves. I was hoping for more."
1,"Please see my review of the ThermaCELL MR-1C on why I decided not to use this product after I did some research on the synthetic chemical they use.....and, why I now use simple household, white distilled vinegar instead! Works 100% effective so far!"
2,"The nuvi 350 GPS navigator works great. The text to speech is an option that you want to have. I found it very helpful while driving the interstates around Milwaukee. Roads to the right, left and straight. The voice prompt or touch the screen to repeat helps to keep your eyes on the traffic. Uploading the recent map online does take a lot of time even with a DSL connection. The initial startup does take several minutes to acquire the satellites."
1,"Mr. Paul Rout has proffered a highly jounalistic and prosaic account of the life and teaching of Bonaventure and his spiritual father Francis. The book is poorly constructed and offers very little grounded information. Rout is a memenber of the Franciscans yet fails to comprehend the basic tenets and teaching of the men who shaped the order to which he belongs. Perhaps he should have joined then Jesuits who, as anyone will tell you, understand the principles of scholarship and spirituality needed to tackle the profound insights of these two thinkers. From the shoddy presentation, however, it is clear that Rout could not even finish the elementary stages of a Jesuit formation."
2,"what's wrong, i don't know. i haven't receivd my CDs yet. It's too bad sevice. the seller is not responsible their shipping service"
2,"I am a mystery buff reader and Kate was able to grab my attention and keep me reading. The storyline and characters are all brought to life. The orientation of the main character Cassidy James is not the focus of the book, but an added twist. I look forward to reading the rest of her series!"
1,"Great pictures, I'll give it that. However, I felt the book was assuming too much, especially for the beginning rider. Great ideas, but not much instruction to back the pictures up. If you really progressed as fast as the pictures without professional help, kudos to you. Otherwise, not realistic. Common faults illustrated will continue without someone else (ie a trained professional) to back you up."
2,"Great little book for visual learners like me! For a new coach, this easy to carry little book helps review points and build confidence before appointments. Illustrations, diagrams and checklists are great to use in helping prioritize what needs to be addressed with clients, how to do so, and how to remain focused and be a better coach. I highly recommend it as a general pocket guide that is easy to carry with you because it's small, easy to read, understand and implement."
1,"I'm always surprised on how nobody dares to discover when the king goes naked.Every record I hear singed by this woman bore me more than her former one.I really would LOVE to find something on this. But i don't.Someone said ""flamenco redefined"".Really far away from this definition, stand this sound.There are far more consistent names ( both male and female ) deserving that goal and buika is not one of them.If you are lucky enough to fall in a mighty producer hands then almost half or more of te way is done.I'm afraid that is the case here.Listen to Ojos Verdes sung by the first woman to translate it into jazz, Martirio, and try holding Buika version far thanfive seconds if you can..."
2,"It seems that the company has sorted out its issues with the hardware. I had read many reviews about how the hardware was missing, or it was all in one box. The bed arrived with all the pieces and, the hardware was separated in different compartments. The bed seems like a good sturdy bed, especially for the price. It does seem like it marks up easily. I bashed it slightly when trying to install one of the drawers, and it left a mark. It took my husband and I three hours to put together, and we are happy with our purchase. The drawers are of adequate size, and I happy with them hidden under the bed, even if they are made of particle board. The mattress seems like it would slide about, but I have used a bed rail to hold it in place."
2,"I just finished listening to this yesterday in my car. Sissy Spacek is a wonderful reader. To have her read ANYTHING to me in my car is a priceless treasure, but to listen to her rendition of To Kill a Mockingbird was truly an anti-doldrumine! She (and Harper Lee) had me in tears more than once. This reading of this venerable classic, an examination of racial prejudice and human interactions, is highly recommended!!"
2,"La verdadera Sabiduria te la da la VIDA, cuando empiezas a respirar, a observar, a vivir, a SER lo que llevo por dentro en mi corazon. El Maestro KUTUMI ilumina mi vida cuando atravez de su rayo DORADO igual que el SOL, me hacer ver lo que me impide vivir. Gracia a el volvi a respirar,a ver, a sentir o sea a ¡volvi a VIVIR !"
1,"I bought this when there was an offer for an upgrade to 2010. Some of the reviewers claimed to have gotten it, but I did not. Nor can I find any good place to ask Amazon about it. I used to really like Amazon. The customer service is really not as good as it once was.The product itself is typical Microsoft fare. You'd do better to stick with Open Office for free if you can help it."
2,Can't go wrong with Sophocles! This is an okay version of Antigone. A great value for the price and Antigone is always a good read!
2,"I saw Dr. Edell on the ""Today in New York"" program yesterday (Tuesday, April 27), and bought his book the same day. His sense of humor and refreshing tone kept me reading long past my usual bedtime. I was impressed with all of the research that had gone into the book - he doesn't jump on the bandwagon unless real studies have been done, not trials with 10 people that are paid for by the drug company. Eat, Drink, & Be Merry should be on everyone's book shelf - it's general enough to cover a lot of health topics, and specific enough to give real answers."
2,"This was fairly easy to install. It arrived quickly. It puts the keyboard and mouse in a comfortable position. I purchased one for a co-worker and it worked so well, I purchased another for another co-worker."
2,What a wonderful compilation of educational and heartwarming stories! I have four domestic housecats myself and have oftentimes wondered what similarities or differences they might share with their close cousins. NOW I KNOW! What strikes me the most throughout the material is the responsibilty displayed by the lucky folks who own or shall I say are owned by these wonderful cats. I find it compelling that such a special relationship can evolve from these wild cats. My domestics are only a cathair away from them evolutionary wise and it was refreshing to see the same feelings that I have for mine expressed through these admirable small exotic feline owners. Kudos and I truly hope to see more future material of this nature. Thanks for the valuable product!
2,"In 1960, when I was close in age to Diahann Carroll, I was perusing jazz albums and was attracted to a Porgy & Bess LP with one of my favourite Jazz groups, The Andre Previn Trio. The cover featured an incredibly beautiful young woman on her debut recording. I bought the album, and so began a lifetime of enjoying and sharing the fantastic voice of Diahann Carroll; I now have everything she has recorded....including a CD version of that first album, Porgy & Bess. This retrospective on Ms. Carroll, brilliantly and entertainingly presented through interview by veteran PBS newswoman,Gwen Ifill, gives one a full and very complete lifetime view in Ms. Carroll's words in conversation with Ms Ifill. The program is interspersed with both musical and dramatic clips of this wonderful artist's half century of successful talent in both song and acting performances. And she is still as beautiful as ever."
2,"10/10, Game of the Year, need anymore be said?Pros - Fantastic Single player, engrossing storyCons - Lack of multiplayer- Lack of cutscenes/videos- Only on Xbox 360 when I bought itBottom line: Best Single player Xbox 360 game there is"
2,"These wire hiders are great and the adhesive is awesome... Maybe too awesome. I had to make some minor adjustments after the first install and not only did I pull off paint, but also a couple layers of drywall. This really isn't a bad thing, you want them to stick to the surface and do it well, I just want to make sure I call it our for fellow renters. I was able to run 4 wires approximately 50 feet, a sub woofer cable, ethernet, and x2 sets of speaker wire. It was a super tight fit, but I made it work. Be sure to run the wires before you stick to the wall as closing the seal is much more difficult once applied to the surface."
1,I purchased this tub because I really liked the concept of being able to expand it as necessary yet not have it so large for a newborn. It has been a disaster and leaks all the time. Definitely not worth the money.
2,I have fond memmories of watching this movie with my mom as a kid. Its still hilarious and I would recommend it.Not for children under 15 or so.
1,"At first, I bought a couple of 100dvd+r spindles, the ones that were not completely printable and they worked awesome. Almost 100% efficiency at 1$ a dvd. Then I purchased the ones fully printable worth .60cts each. These Stunk Big Time. I had at least a 25% failure ratio. These should be taken off the market and replace them with the more expensive ones. Suggestion, Don't buy them. You'll hate yourself."
2,"I finished the book last month--fast reading enjoyable. However, my previous Marquez title was ""Love In The Time Of Cholera."" Somehow this book felt like a smaller version of the former. For example, the sin both books mature as ""protagonist"" through their old age, they both are pretty much glorified ""whore-mongers,"" they both have issues with love, both have a mother figure in their lives, both books are full of steamy sexual moments, in both cases the ""true-love"" remains delayed, asexual (it becomes or hints to become sexual only when that ""higher love"" is materialized or implied to materialize towards the end of both books), and of course, the girls are in both cases quite younger than the protagonist.I was actually going to give 3.5 stars, but Amazon does not have 1/2 star system. So, this time, Marquez amigo gets 4.Try it-not bad, not too great either."
1,"I'm not sure why nobody else said anything about how easily these cards come apart. Images do print great on this paper and it's of good quality, but unless I want my cards to fall apart this paper does not work for me. I am not satisfied with this product."
1,"I had high hopes for this pillow, since I have severe neck pain. It really did not do the job and now it sits in my closet. I do not recommend."
1,"An obvious vanity publication that lacks imagination, cohesiveness and any shred of talent. Save your time, effort, and most of all, your money. The first in a series? I can not believe that there are two more books of this dribble existing in the small, narrow mind of this so-called author. But vanity publishers will accept just about anything, I guess."
1,"totally poor choice of purchase.there is VERY little info in this book that can't be gleamed from the user's guide + playing around with the system for a couple of days.Large sections of text simply go through and provide primers on the various apps in the install dirs, etc. I don't need to spend $$$ to find out what happens when I double click on some icons."
2,I loved this movie so much !! I watch it at least once a week. Leo is such a good actor ! He is so incredibly HOTT !!! This movie made me understand Shakespeare so much better ! And it also made me get into it more when you watch the movie and not just read it from the book ! Leo made the whole movie Awesome though ! ! I LOVE LEO !! END
1,"The DRM on this game is RIDICULOUS. My husband and I share a MacBook. He installed the game under his user account. Later on I logged in under my account and started the game up.IT ASKED ME FOR A REGISTRATION KEY!I didn't want to use up a second install, so I guess I'm stuck playing under his account. This means that all of our user-data is shared.Not only is this game limited to three installations, it is limited to only three separate user accounts ON THE SAME COMPUTER.I am so mad. If I could return this game, I would."
2,"Now here is a CD that takes me back. I grew up on this stuff and listening to it took me back to those nights sitting around with the guys, smoking our cigarettes and playing cards or cruising. If you want a CD that will take you to an earlier time, then look no farther. ""Monster Ballads"" is it. From the 1st song to the last, there is nothing but the best of 80's and early 90's ballad rock. These guys were the Marvin Gayes of the rock wopld and this album proves beyond a doubt that love is still alive.Enjoy."
1,Considering the life she's led I would have expected more from Slick's autobiography. A big yawn--I skimmed through the last 200 pages.
2,"I've been a sporadic Del Amitri fan for about ten years now. I like how well their songs are constructed, the obvious care put into their production - harmonies to die for. And they've got great taste in influences, all of which abounds on their 'best of' disc, Hatful of Rain.The big news, though, is the first cut, Cry To Be Found. This is the only new material on the disc, and it's electrifying. Musically, it's like nothing the Dels have done before. It's silky strings and sexy slow tempo would be appropriate for Marvin Gaye, but here are these pale scotsmen making a masterpiece of blue-eyed soul. Justin Currie's singing has a new sensuality in the falsetto chorus and the verses as well. The lyric is as sophisticated as the sound.Listen to this disc. All there was to like about Del Amitri for the last ten years is there, along with a new cut that suggests more amazing things to come."
1,Came as scheduled...first box - fine - not rips or tears. Inside box - fine - no damage. Coffee maker - BIG dent on the right side a little below half way up...you know what? It still makes pretty good coffee! Looks aren't everything and we need coffee!
2,"For my money Jeremy Brett will always be the definitive screen Holmes. In addition, these Granada TV adaptations employed fine writing that hewed faithful to the original stories and nifty production values in sets, costumes, etc. It's a shame that the ""extras"" (cast bios and stills) are so skimpy, but the episodes themselves should be considered essential for Holmes fans and collectors. This box set of 13 episodes on 5 discs comes at a better price than the individual volumes purchased seperately, an unhappy situation for those who have been buying the volumes as they were released, but a boon for those who've held off until now. There's no excuse now : get these DVDs."
2,"The best Damned album and one of my faves period. Everything but Feel the Pain is amazing. Their cover of 1970 (they call it ""I feel alright) is absolutely stunning. In the end it's much like the first Floyd album, Piper. It doesn't sound much like the rest of The Damned's stuff, but it's just plain better than the rest of their stuff. Anyone looking for a great punk album without the chance of some hardcore activism and with a bit of a joker innem should get this album."
2,"This is a good modern country effort. All of the more uptempo numbers are very good and quite catchy. Some of the slower songs become kind of boring, which keeps this disc from getting five stars. The disc is definitely worth buying though."
1,"This is an early book. Siddons did write a scary book, but I did not like that it was so unbelievable."
2,"We have a 21 yr. old daughter and a 11.5 yr. old daughter and trying to find a movie for all of us to watch together can be challenging at times. We laughed and had fun together! Our 21 yr. old laughed and smiled and rolled her eyes some but our 11.5 yr. old loved it and wanted to do the cheers and dances in our home,only.A little bit of the language and additude pushed the limits I allow in our lives and home but these movies(Bring It On: Cheertastic 3-Movie Pack)allowed us to have a fun night together! Our 11.5 yr. old had friends over for a sleepover and they had a blast with these movies and popcorn! I don't know how many times they have been played now. I would reccomend this to a parent of a middleschooler or older and especially if the like cheerleading! They are cute,fun,and a value for the cost!"
1,Love the show but hate having to wait until 3:30 am EST Wednesday morning to get a download of a show that airs on Monday night. Apple always has it the next morning. Get with the program Amazon.
2,"VERY!!!! Traian is amazing. Dark Descent is breathtakingly arousing and quite the adrenaline pumper. You begin with action and end wanting more. Ms. Feehan has done a superb job continuing her Dark Series, this is a must have for all Carpathian fans. I'd love to give this more than 5 stars!!!"
2,"I love this bag I put it so easy onto my bicycle, use it everyday. The service was fast made me very happy, it is also very well made so thank you very much I will do business with you again"
2,"The single disk was housed in a ""clever"" fool proof plastic box. I felt like a fool trying to get the blasted catches to unhook on the sides. I finally had to take some scissors to pry the things open on the side so the case could finally hinge open. Yep, I saw and cut the tougher than steel plastic tape holding the case closed. It was those insidious side catches that were like super glue. After that, it was an easy install on my Toshiba notebook with Vista. I did a clean install; fresh. The software included the Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and OneNote programs. I didn't need Outlook so this was just what I needed. Works like a charm."
2,This was one of the last volumes needed for my daughters collection and turned out to be one of the better episodes !
1,"What a crock! Science?!?! Oh yeah...I guess our scientists are so caught up in quantum mechanics and quarks that they overlooked the fundamental 'stuff', the 'thinking substance' that this joke of a book purports to be the elemental 'stuff' that everything is made up of. Apparently LSD was compounded around 1910 when this moron obviously tested some and came up with this fiction. Don't waste your money. If it's too late and you already bought the book at least you could use it a fuel or a table stabilizer. Don't waste your time reading it unless you are in the mood for some serious B.S.!"
1,"I like the chapters covering programming languages such as python, perl and Tcl/tck. However it was frustrating and very difficult to follow; it assumes a lot of knowledge on the user's part and jumps around on specific instructions--to tell you the truth the book was a waste of money. Red Hat really needs to tailor their documentation to the ""complete idiot"" (oh well, I guess I qualify)."
2,"Peggy's story is definitely a fun read, if not a fun life in itself. It reminds us of how secondary money can be to finding true love. She was the product of a wild time in history and this book, while well-written, makes me want to read her story in her own hand. A good ""map to the stars"" if you're interested in some gossip on the artists of the period. I paid next to nothing for the book - if I had paid full price, I might have felt a little less satisfied."
2,"This is great for the price...my kitten loves it, just didn't know it has hole to lower part, so fyi if you're looking for 2 separate sleep areas."
2,"This item is the best resolution on the market today, and the wood grain frame looks great. The functionality is good and simple once you get used to it. Capabilities for USB and Memory Card are very versatile. Out of the box, i was up and running in under 15 minutes. My only complaint is that the frame doesn't autorotate, but it's great that it has it's own hard drive you can save photos too. If you can drop the $200, it is a great digital photo frame."
1,"Never got to watch it since I was sent one that wasn't from our region.. super disappointed. I'm still new to Amazon and this is one of those ""ooohhh this is what I thought might happen"" moments. It all had the too good too be true feel. I'm still going to try to return it, but its a lot of effort for something I probably won't see again anyway. :("
1,"The plastic handles are very flimsy, and the padded grip gives no comfort. Better off using a set of dumbbells. I was very disappointed in this item, will not be using it at all. I would return to Amazon if they didn't charge you for it."
1,Besides being extremely noisy even after firmware upgrade the enclosure IS NOT metallic it is just a plastic enclosure covered with grey paper...Very disappointed...
2,"This book has beautiful illustrations! The story itselfs is very simple, which makes it even better. I gave it as a gift to my 11 year-old niece. Her name is Emily and she loves it, as Well as my sister did too. It's a perfect gift for a baby girl, a young girl or a woman. It will definitely make a mark in your loved one's heart. I strongly recommend it."
2,"Although I haven't finished reading the book, I find it's very interesting and have gained more knowledge concerning the proper handling of money and how to make it grow.I'll highly recommend this book."
1,Boring. Predictable. Boring. Perhaps if TG leaves had hallucinogenic properties more interesting plot lines good have been developed. Maybe I am too critical of mediocrity.
1,"Don't believe the hype with this book. Pretentious, deliberately opaque, and just plain boring, this is one of those books that leaves you nonplussed at how the judges of the National Poetry Series justified giving it an award. Yawn."
2,This item is perfect for those who want to utilize their large flat screen as an additional monitor. i was pleased with both the quality and pricing on this item. Great deal as opposed to my local electronic store.
2,"Love this exercise book. Austin clearly outlines the program, which is easy to follow and effective. With a variety of exercise options, the program allows you to choose what's best and easiest for you, regardless of time constraints. I especially like that Austin is a little older so is aware of the needs of women ""of a certain age."""
1,"These DVD's are junk. I have tried half of the spindle and can't get one to record. I have used two different burners and niether will record them. They either spit them back out with a message such as ""unrecordable"" or they record half way and then spit them out with different error messages.They must be made in China and should be recalled. I'll stick with Memorex."
2,"a little dissapointing for the price. as the saying goes , they dont make em like they use to.first of all , like other reviews the grips tend to wiggle , I solved that problem with a little stick-em. second , like the other reviews , the paint by the serial numbers is flaking, wich lets the brass show thru. i am still satisfied with the gun. however i will carefully choose my ""made in the U.S.A "" products from now on. update 2012. after firing 1000 plus pellets thru this gun, it still has as much power as it did when new, and the sights are still right on. i have taken a fair number of squirrels with this. i now give it 4 stars instead of three."
2,"If you never read another book, read this one.It's a real eyeopener for anyone who thinks the world has done them in, and there's no way out of the financial/emotional hole you're in. I read it 33 years ago when Bob Ringer first had it published and again recently. His logic is as sound today as it was back then!"
1,"The cable is exactly what I was looking for but, unfortunately, as soon as I connected it to my computer a message popped up saying the device was corrupt."
1,"I couldn't wait to get this book. It sounded like a great story of adventure across several continents. After the first chapter I deeply regreted my purchase. What had great potential turned out to be two guys boasting about their popularity and how it was going to be difficult being celebrities. Maybe it's just me, but I wouldn't know them at all, despite their numerous references to the movies they've been in. I thought I was getting a book about the challenges of travel abroad and pictures of these places. What I got was a book with too many pictures of the authors, weak stories of the places they stayed in and the food they ate."
2,The book is extremely well written and very insightful. It is more of a life guide than a book you would read just once. I frequently refer back to Covey when I feel out of balance.
2,"I shouldn't have liked this movie, yet somehow I did. I normally would think this kind of movie is really stupid, and yet, this one seems to somehow evade being stupid. It shouldn't have been funny, and yet I found myself laughing. This movie really snuck up on me, and I can't quite figure out why. But there it is, its a pretty good film that I enjoyed in spite of myself (but please don't tell anyone)."
1,Henckels are well known for their use by culinary art professionals. Because of the name alone we purchased this set for a working chef. Unfortunately the price alone should have warned us. This set is not up to the standards for chefs who use thicker blades and use knives that can stand up to sharpening and over use. We are keeping them and will probably save them to give as a wedding gift. They are a good set for Home use.
1,"Harriman edited and altered Rand's journal entries without noting it. This makes this book worthless. And this kind of dishonesty from Harriman is, to use one of Rand's favorite words, evil!"
2,"I use my PC to record TV shows, but had no easy way to watch them on my TV (without constantly burning DVDs). So I needed a media extender and my options were the XBox, Apple's ITV (if it ever gets released) and this Hauppauge MediaMVP. Price helped me choose the Hauppauge with the understanding that if it didn't work out well then I would work on obtaining the XBox.The Media MVP was easy to set up (except that my network cable was bent, but one could hardly blame Hauppauge for that). Load the s/w, plug in the cable and away I went. As others have noted, the interface is dreadful. The interface looks like it would integrate well into the Atari game boxes of the 80's - boxy, low-res and unattractive. Thus I loaded the freeware GBPVR package and turned it into a real PVR solution (live TV with pausing, weather, etc.). At this point I'm well-pleased with the setup."
2,"I bought the limited edtion version of this CD (the one that comes in a special cloth bag with little toys and prizes) and it was so totally worth it! In my opinion, this CD is much better than ""Something Smells Funny in Here"" (even though they are both very good). To me, the songs on this album are much more interesting, and well, there are also more of them. (The more Stinky Puffs the better!) I also much prefer this version of ""I'll Love You Anyway"" to the ones on the EP. If you liked the first CD, trust me, this one will blow your mind.""I Know I Know"" is definately my favorite song. So melodic, innocent and brutally honest. Everything music should be. (Why can't all bands write music like the Stinky Puffs?)""The Vitamin Song"" is also very playful and their cover of ""Dream Weaver"" is certainly something to hear; Timony's cheerful voice will brighten up any day. Total comfort music.If only they recorded more!"
2,"Ive have just read through this book and i think that it is really good. i teaches u techniques that helps u when practicing tummo. and at the same time,it also teaches u on becoming a better person."
1,"I don't know who the other reviewers of this book are, but...what are they thinking?? This book is fine if you are a teenager but for anyone with any experience with the dating world, it is basically a rehash of just plain common sense. Follow good personal hygiene? Dress in a sexy manner? Don't be negative? PLEASE! He mentions 10 sneaky things that men do to women on dates but doesn't deliver. Those are the things we need to know about.Don't waste your time with this book. It just doesn't deliver on its promise of helping women date successfully."
1,[...]I'm so diappointed with this book. I was expecting to have rave hot popular toys listed but instead found some out of date toys that I can no longer find. I searched store after store and found out some are now discontinued.
2,"amazing, the best image resolution ever..i buy the dvd disc, but this blu ray edition is the glorious image definition ever!---every people must view this film..."
2,"St. Faustina's diary is absolutely beautiful. As I have been reading, I have fallen in love with St. Faustina and feel a very strong connection with her. Even as she suffered and struggled, she always stayed focused on Christ and lived her life beautifully for Him. I encourage you to read this book and just enjoy the beauty of how much God loves us."
1,"This has to be the most narcissistic book I have ever read. Another reviewer described it as self-indulgent, and I agree. I started reading this with the best of intentions, but then found myself skipping parts in the hope I would find something relevant and/or meaningful. I found this book to be nothing but private musings and opinions about the most trivial and mundane things, and I could not helping thinking ""who cares?"". At the risk of offending those who liked or even loved it, this was nothing but nonsense and a waste of time."
2,"Familiar with the group of course, but not an owner of all their cds. Played No Code for 1st time today, several times. Thought it extremely good. Especially Red Mosquito, Smile, I'm Open and the last track, Around The Bend. Just couldn't hear that one enough. Made me more curious about the group. Read some of the reviews on this album. Seems they may have left some of their fans comfort zone. They're leaving home - Buy, Buy - Great CD!"
1,"as I said, wine and this book make a good meal. First bake the book at about 350 degrees in an oven, and then take it out, let it cool, just a little, and then smother it with lots of good CHEESE and some yummy tomato sauce, and whatever else you care to put on it. and then just dig in, and munch! It makes a great after ""Norm"" snack. Try it. but note: it will give you a bad case of indigestion, if you eat and go to bed right afterwards. so, make sure to stay awake and up for a while, to avoid this symptom. OK? Oh,...read this book? Naa! Don't think so! but as a snack, hey, what have you got to lose? ;-) wink."
2,"Wordcraft: New English to Old English Dictionary and ThesaurusIf you only know Shakespeare by the fact that he existed and was a play writer and you decide that you want to read one of his history plays and the history play that you pick happens to be King Henry IV part one then just reading the text alone will be extremely confusing. Barbara Hodgdon has done an amazing job editing this play and her notes are extremely helpful besides her explication of this play there are historical graphics and historical maps that will help you when reading or seeing the works of Shakespeare. This book is more than a college textbook, it is enjoyable historical reading. Craig Barr."
2,My 7 year old loves the game Guess Who? so we bought her Guess Where? and she loves it! Any child that likes board games will really like this game. It promotes great interaction between parent and child. I recommend this product.
1,"I tried this product after the product I had been using for 6 years, oxy Maximum Vanish Lotion, was discontinued. With the oxy lotion my skin was FLAWLESS. Once it was discontinued, my skin took a turn for the worse. Since this Persa-Gel 10 also has 10% benzoyl peroxide, I figured I'd give it a try. I'll just say this, ALL BENZOYL PEROXIDE PRODUCTS ARE NOT THE SAME! After using the persa-gel 10 for 2 days I realized it wasn't helping my skin, but I kept at it. After 4 days my skin started getting MANY of the worst kind of pimples. The huge, tender, deep down under the skin pimples that take FOREVER to get rid of.So now not only is my skin worse, but I can't even go back to the product that did work to fix this problem! Very frustrating!"
1,This is a movie where you wait for something to happen and nothing ever does! What's worse is that the ending did not resolve the story. Bill Murray as a kind of loser who receives an unsigned note from an old girlfriend claiming that he is the father of her child. Murray seeks out 4 old girlfriends to find out who might have sent it. The director tries to be cute by having the daughter of one of the women (named Lolita of course) walk around naked in front of him. This was supposed to be the comedy in this film? This movie lacks any real humor and should be avoided at all costs.
2,"Jurassic Park the book and movie were my favorite things to read and watch. Im pre-ordering this the moment i get the money, cant wait for it get here."
2,"I ordered three of these, and when they delivered, all the boxes were damaged on all four corners. Oh no, I thought. But inside the boxes these were carefully packaged, with plastic caps between each shelf on all four corners. Nothing was damaged except the boxes! They were relatively easy to assemble, and it didn't take me long to set up all three. I would recommend these to anyone, for just about any use since they look great too."
1,Worked fine for one winter. And that's the problem with it. Save your money and buy something else unless you want to replace them every year. I switched to the allied stock tank heater. That heater is still going strong after two winters in my pond.
2,I haven't seen anything this funny since the Monty Python glory days. Very clever shows with great cast and funny dialog. A Must see.
1,maybe it's the fact that i was exposed to weird things during my formative teenage years that i still have some kind of curiosity toward solondz et al. regardless this was tedious to watch and i wish i hadn't.
1,"First: I still like the smell!Second: I agree with the other 1-2 star reviewers, that it is hard to believe that this is an original.I used the perfume years ago and it really lasted the whole day, ""delivering"" compliments not only from my wife;-). As it is really expensive, I stopped using it for some years. Now, being in the US, I searched for it again and gave it a try, as I couldn't imagine to get a ""fake"". But most likely I was wrong.So be careful and try to get and original GIT in a perfumery, where you can test it for one day;-)Again it used to be a fantastic smell!!!"
2,"Kool Savas is one of the best MCs around in Germany.I'm from Berlin myself so i know his skills. hes damn tallented and lived in the USA for some years.This is his first Official-Release and it should give him some props.Well its pretty old so if you like this i'd tell you to check out his new Cd ""Der Beste Tag Meines Lebens(engl. The best day of my life)"" at amazon.de. It features people like Royce tha 5'9 and Kurupt.so check it out and get this one too its off the chain."
1,"One of the most frustrating pieces of equipment I have ever bought. The legs need to be fully extended for them to securely lock into place, if not, a simple adjust to the camera causes the leg(s)to collapse. Get set for that perfect picture, press zoom, there goes the leg. Better off buying a tripod with individually locking leg sections."
2,"I have bought and given out so many copies of this book it is surprising that they haven't arrested me for encouraging the use of an addictive substance. Be ready because if you start reading Eye of The World, you will not be able to stop. You will find yourself with one book after another with you at all times. When you finally come to the last completed book (12), it will be an empty day. What will you read during the little snatches of time throughout the day? How will you escape the doldrums? Nothing will delight your life like Wheel of Time. The last book is promised to arrive soon, so I decided to read the first over. It was 20 years ago when it all started. I have to say, the first book is as good the second time through as the first time, what fun."
1,"I'm not going to give this event a whole review, because it doesn't deserve it. Let me say one thing: Randy Orton and Rob Van Dam fighting for the IC Title is the only reason to even rent this tape. The Triple Threat matched was barely even hyped up, it was almost like HBK/Batista was their money match, that match was decent, but nothing special. RVD/ORTON = CLASSIC BATTLE FOR THE INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP = Only reason to even rent this pile of dung"
1,"I wanted an inexpensive phone for my kitchen. Sadly, with this phone, you get what you pay for. The call quality is very poor. It has a lot of static - sounds like you're in a tunnel. Also, after 1 year, the caller ID display failed. Now you can only see bits and pieces of words and numbers. There is no way to obtain a number of a missed call if the caller didn't leave a message.To summarize, save your money and buy another phone."
1,The black plastic is flimsey. The legs don't fit in securely. The table top isn't level. I could blow on it and knock it over. My lap is much more stable. A waste of money.
1,At full pressure 2 out of 4 tubes suffered catastropihic failures - the seams developed splits. I wouldn't purchase them again.
1,This book was recommended by the Gestalt Therapy Institute in California. I suggest that you don't buy it. I thought think that there are better books out there that explain the same crap in a simple manner. If you are more advanced you may prefer but if you are a student or beginner don't bother. Even if you are advanced the book sucks.
1,I gave this one plenty of chances but it never made me want to listen to it. Colma (only other Buckethead CD I have) was hit or miss for me but at least those hits existed!
1,"My daughter got this book when she was two. I found it annoying that the book wasn't consistent. For example...a baby horse is called a foal, but a baby sheep is a sheep, not a lamb. With so many great books out there, I would skip this one."
2,My wife and I have watched this movie over 100 times. We have worn out two VHS tapes and are sick that we can't get it in DVD and that they didn't release a soundtrack. It is our favorite movie of all times and would buy either in a split second.
2,"I purchased 4 books to prepare for the CSET and this one was by far the most comprehensive. If you know the info in this book, you will ACE the test. That is one of the problems, however. This book is SOOOOOO detailed that sometimes it's frustrating. However this book, in my opinion was KEY to me passing the test. The other books helped with practice tests, but I mainly studied from this one. Took all 3 tests the same day and passed them all on the first try. Good luck!!"
2,"I found this book to be filled with helpful hints, relevant examples and lots of practice problems. It helped concentrated my studies on the most appropriate exam areas."
2,My grandbaby LOVES Eric Carle books and this was a wonderful Christmas addition. It is a beautiful book. I totally recommend it.
1,"Got one as a gift and now have to return it. It is not as ""universal"" as it states. The only way you can keep a Peg Perego Primo Viaggio car seat from completely falling off is to use a strap that it somes with. The car seat does not lock onto anything, but merely rests on the bar. The problem with having to strap the car seat down is that the strap goes OVER the baby's chubby legs and/or belly. It doesn't leave much room for an infant once you secure the car seat to the stroller."
2,"These books are simply gorgeous. They are top-quality, with glossy paper and come in a very sturdy box. However, they books are a LOT larger and heavier than I expected, which is fine, but would definitely make reading them difficult. It would be a burden to have to carry them around, as each individual book is surprisingly heavy. However, they are great collector's items, meant to last. I bought them because they look nice, and I wanted to own a better copy of this magnificent series other than my old beaten up paperback editions. (I will still use the paperbacks for re-reading, though!)Even so, they are wonderful copies, and I highly recommend them if you are looking for a nice edition to collect or display. I think it would have been better if they made these books more practical, though, as nice as they are."
1,"I cannot recommend this product. I bought a few, excited to try my hand at sprouting.Well, today is the 3rd day, and the sprouts have been doing well! The alfalfa outgrew the clover and mung beans, so I decided to harvest some of it. Imagine my disgust when I unscrewed the lid and found that the screen had turned black along the edge! I wouldn't call it rust -- it's not red -- more like some less-friendly oxidation. (Nickel? Chromium?) And the black wasn't just some surface-finish, but a fine powder. I tried eating some of the sprouts, but couldn't, because they had a very strong metallic taste. Possibly poisonous, but definitely not wholesome. What a waste of my first batch of sprouts.I won't be deterred from this little hobby, but I'm going to pick up some of the plastic perforated lids instead.Notes: The edges are rough-cut, not finished or folded over. Also, if you do decide to ignore my recommendation and buy this product, it is designed to fit a widemouth jar."
2,"Not knowing what I was getting into I had bought the first three books in the series, and I just finished Dhampir. This is an Awesome book, it tells the story from multiple view points and you love both sides. The battle sequenceing is one of the best I have ever read. This book is a buyer!"
1,"The picture for the product was hilarious, but my dog doesn't carry it that way, I don't think any dow will. My dog chewed it up in less than a day."
1,"The jack snapped off the antenna during assembly, rendering the whole thing useless. Cheaper is not always better I guess. If anyone has a suggestion for a HDTV antenna that won't fall apart in your hands, I'm all ears."
1,"The product arrived on time, straight from Hong Kong. It only works every once in a while with Apple products. When I plug in the USB it will charge for a few minutes and then stop. Since it mentioned iPods in the description, this is what I purchased it for. Also, there is a red light that illuminates indicating that it is plugged in. The red light is incredibly bright and somewhat distracting when driving at night. Also, the light doesn't turn off when your car is turned off, so it acts as if it were a light house notifying all car burglars of possible electronics in the car. But like I mentioned in the title, I didn't expect a whole lot for the price."
1,This dvd player worked for a few month and broke. It would take more money to fix it then to buy a new one. I'm very unhappy with this device.
2,"Centric brake rotors are a solid value brand and I have these on my second car. They are quiet, have great stopping power and last a reasonably long time. These are NOT performance rotors and I would not put them on V8 corvette but on a 1994 Nissan Sentra they work great."
2,"when i first saw the cd in the store and looked at the back, i wasn't interested. but afterseeing the movie, a friend and i decided to go buy it. i have to admit, i was dead wrong! i love this cd! i like how there's a mix of different songs. my favorites are: ""rocket collecting"" by milla; ""suicide note"" b johnette napolitano; ""hover"" by trust company; and rev 22:20. i also like the few instrumental intro songs! overall, this is a great cd. i think there's only 1 or 2 out of the 19 songs that i don't like."
2,"This book is more a compilation of previously published stories of the Author and less a new volume of work. It is also oddly laid out. If you like Hans Holzer's slightly blase' and clinical take on the supernatural, and don't mind a stroll down memory lane, then this is the book for you."
2,"If there ever was a book that illustrated the ways and means of changing and hardening of a heart of a man, Franz Stangl, from an anti-Nazi, Austrian Police Captain into the Treblinka Kommendant, the most despicable extermination camp, killing 6 million, this book is it!I read this book years ago and have since purchased it for several of my friends. One can read this and see the parallels to today in our government, the uprising, the mob mentality, the increase in the cost of food, oil and other necessities, the loss of freedoms, and more. It really shows that history can and does repeat itself.I think everyone should read this book and look at the signs. It is incredible. It is amazing that Sereny was even able to get inside the prison to interview Stangl.This is a must read book."
1,"I'm very disappointed, I can't feel the smell, well...only if I get close one inch of the bottle!! Smell just a bit in the morning when open the car and 5 second later the smell go away!! bad product try something else I don't recommend this product."
2,"WHY IS THIS BOOK NOT AVAILABLE ON KINDLE???? It's more than a bit silly to have the first and last books in the series available on the Kindle, but not the middle book. Yes, very silly indeed.Amazon, please rectify this immediately.Thank you."
2,Great video. Great workout for my buns! I have tried several work out videos in the past and haven't had interest in sticking with it. Kendra makes it fun and keeps me motivated! Thank you Kendra
1,"I picked this up as I was interested in the circa-WWI time period in US. The unfolding story drew me in and held my intense interest... until the weak and unsatisfying ending.The author seems to have done his homework quite well in exhaustively researching the time period and developing characters and plots accordingly. But when considering the book's length (~700 pages), it seemed the author was perhaps rushed to end the book by tying up loose ends/characters in short, weak, and ultimately unsatisfying scenes that left me feeling shortchanged.To me, the best part of the book was the opening vignette ""Babe Ruth in Ohio"". This piece, which can be read as a stand-alone short story, was worth the price of admission. However, I felt the ending revealed a work not overall worthy of the time needed to read it."
1,"I may have done permanent damage to my child's cognitive development by letting him watch it. Rehashed, unoriginal crap designed to steal your money."
1,"Be sure to check with the seller that the cards are included with the set...The book alone will do you no good without the cards, as the book was written exclusively for those cards.Sent back for refund."
2,"Silk Road 2 is a beautiful piece of music, and again Kitaro shows himself to be a master in painting a picture with music. The ten pieces on this disk are exquisitely done and can, if you let them, transport you to another place and time. This is an excellent sequel to Silk Road 1, and I highly recommend it."
1,"Overall, this brush is great... EXCEPT that it pretty much scratched up the entire TV screen. It is advertised to ""...gently dust delicate surfaces. Keeps fans, blinds, televisions, and keyboards dust-free."" Not only that, but on the Dyson website, the demo shows the brush on the screen of a TV! I VERY carefully dusted my NEW TV, and it has scratches all over it now! EEEK! I am in contact with Dyson to see what they will do to fix the issue, and my TV. We'll see..."
2,"Where was this book during my last acting class? Ms. Nichols book is long overdue. The only other scene book I could find was so outdated I felt I needed to wear a zoot suit. This scene book is so great. I took it to my acting class and everyone practically did handstands. Never again will I have to struggle with scene partners who depend on me to find an appropriate scene. Now and forever I can hand them this book (if they already don't have one of their own) and say: ""Here are 99 scences to pick from."" From one struggeling actor I say, thank-you, thank-you, thank-you for providing this wonderful tool to us all. You are the best!"
2,Our child doesn't have to be reminded to use the spell check very often when he writes. However auto-correcct and some of the other optionns given don't always have the meaning he is going for. This speller & dictionary comes in handy once the writing assignment has been hand written or printed out for proof reading. The dictionary can be a little slow and some words are just not available unless you look them up the old fashioned way with an actual dictionary; but I still rate it at 4 stars. Learning new words takes time and I don't think an 8 to 10 second wait is going to hurt anybody.
2,"I purchased this book for a young woman who is very much into knitting. The purchase arrived promptly and in excellent condition. The gift recipient was delighted. This was a book she had wanted for quite some time. By the way, I intended to purchase the book at a bookstore and found the price to be almost double what it was by purchasing through Amazon.com and the cost of shipping."
2,"What a guy. The Talent this chap has is amazing. Not only does he work for Devon Knight, he's a top singer.If you buy one album this year buy this. With so many top tracks i just dont know which is my favourite.Also Mr Hasselhoff can be seen playing a arcade game in the film Flashdance. This Guy is the MAN!!!!!!!!"
2,"DovBer Pinson takes the reader on a crash course through Chabad style meditation techniques. This book is clearly written and easy to understand. However, the reader should be aware that the style of meditation taught here is extremely challenging. As a Chabad approach, it stresses intellectual elements; unlike other forms of mediation, which involve the body, breathing, postures (sometimes all) Pinson's approach is strictly intellectual. He provides a challenging form of mental self-discipline for anyone who wishes to try it."
1,"I bought this about 5 days ago but am very disappointed. The basic GPS function giving you latitude and long works ok but the MapCompanion mapping software does not. You have to download an upgrade to get it to work at all on my Visor Neo and the key pull down ""Menu"" button never appears on the screen and you are left helpless to switch modes or maps. City and county maps do not seem to integrate, either. I am going to return this thing and get my money back."
2,"Purchased for my husband after seeing on Dr. Oz. He likes it, but it is too soon see to know if it will prevent fever blisters."
1,Not near as funny as I remembered it from the first time around years ago. I was a little disappointed.
2,"I can't add much to the positive reviews already posted. The blends of drums, flutes, rattles, etc. are relaxing yet, at the same time, very enlivening. Great for long walks, relaxing, or meditation. I think I'm getting hooked on it."
2,After weeks of usage I can say that I have had positive results while using this Forest Green Japanese Bath Salts product. Plan to continue using on a continual basis.
1,"I thought it was cool that a woman had the nerve to follow a dream and move to a completely foreign city.However, it's NOT cool that she lived off her rich parents' dime and didn't bother to get a job. It's not cool that she lied to her friends and told them that she taught English when in fact she lived in an apartment with a doorman while doing nothing.It's not cool that everyone she danced with thought she was, ahem, 'EASY', shall we say.And the most unfortunate thing at all is that after years of not working and doing nothing BUT dancing tango and ballet, she still looks like and ABSOLUTE beginner (judging from her website).Hey, at least she got mom and dad to fly her to Greece once the going got tough. That's pretty cool."
1,Dittohead's Guide to Adult Beverages was very boring and unentertaining! It seems as though it was written by an amateur. This book should have been e-published. The author's attempts at wit fall pretty flat. Don't waste your time or money on this.
2,"HI,THIS COUPON ORGANIZER IS REALLY HELPFUL, ITS COMPACT, FITS OVER THE CART HANDLE, AND HAS BEENVERY USEFUL WHEN I AM GOING SHOPPING.....ITS LIGHTWEIGHT, SOFT TO THE TOUCH, AND I REALLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE THIS TYPE OF ORGANIZER, AND THE PRICES ARE RIGHT...I ALSORECEIVED THIS VERY QUICKLY IN THE MAIL....."
1,Bought from ANTonline. product arrived defective & they did not want to pay for return shipping.
2,"This beatifully set anthology features stories of all stripes - from girdles to spankings, colors to places to races to professions. Any and every fetish awaits you, with stories by powerful writers who make each page sizzle. Not every reader will actually indulge in every fetish here, but you can enjoy all of these wonderfully crafted, deliciously detailed stories by some wonderful writers, and on topics that are both accepted parts of the fetish world and novel takes on underappreciated kinks."
2,This jacket is basicaly pretty good. My only gripe is that the belt clip hangs up on the enclosure seal when you rotate it. So I have to use 2 hands to spin it.
1,The material contained in this book is redundant with so many others with the focus on increasing the health (spirit and activism) of the congregation.
1,"My husband got this in October 2009 (9 months ago). We live where it is very cold in the winter), and he gets to work at 6 AM. He was thrilled with this thermos, because it kept his tea HOT well into the afternoon. A few weeks ago, he noticed that it isn't keeping his tea hot, even 3 hours. I think the vacuum seal let go, as there is no glass to break. Very disappointing. Yes, its under warranty, but you have to send it back, which is a hassle."
2,"Dr. Sears provides down to earth suggestions and solutions to coping with a fussy baby. He also provides some reassurance to new parents who aren't quite sure what to do with a screaming baby. I think his ideas about parenting are logical and seem to reinforce what intuitively I already knew. Dr. Sears also provides support for his beliefs about attachment parenting and sharing sleep. It's also wonderful to hear that his style of parenting is not an all or nothing style. He merely suggests that parents need to do whatever works for them and their unique little person. Ultimately, Dr. Sears just wants parents to be just that, PARENTS."
1,"It starts with a good begining, moves in to a dull middle and then an unsatisfiying predictable ending. I really have a problem with his dialog. Every character talks like a 50 year former member of the military."
1,When i first saw the game i thought it would be a really cool game. IT IS NOT! It is very hard to play and is not fun at all. If your looking for a good skateboarding game get Tony Hawk. It is way better.
1,"Helllo! I am Mambo Racine Sans Bout, the same Mambo Racine about whom Ross Heaven has so many nice things to say in his book, ""Vodou Shaman"". It is with some regret that I must warn the prospective reader that most of what is in this book never actually happened - Ross is willing to say anything for a buck, apparently. He never let me see what he was writing until the book was published, and I never imagined he would make up so many stories! Now that I have refused to support his activities he is very angry with me, but the fact remains that this book is 99% BUNK. [...]"
2,"I was skeptical about renting Monster-In-Law after all the bad reviews I had heard. I am glad I did!! Yes, it is not Oscar material, but it is still a fun movie. I enjoyed it and so did my husband. The only part I found unrealistic is how easy it was for Charly to get Viola to move out of their house. In real life, I'm sure it would not have been that easy. I would have like to seem more of Viola's mother in law too. She was funny!!! Wanda Sykes provides comic relief and is hilarious. Ignore the bad reivews and give it a try!"
1,I ordered a book from Bookmans over a month ago and never received the item. They don't allow customers to track a package so who knows if they ever sent it because they refuse to contact me about it. Don't order items from this company!
1,"Allison Dubois is not a real medium, please don't waste your money. She is a joke and gives real mediums a bad name."
2,The item is as described on the website and it was easy to use and install. It has given a great look to my car and the family enjoyed it.
1,"I bought the Poulan Pro 2 Summer's ago, and it ran for most of the season then it started surging and burning oil. I brought it to the local lawnmower repair shop, and he repaired the carburetor, replaced the spark plug and filter. It ran well for the second season. Now it's starting to surge and sputter after one month into the third season. I always run the engine until the fuel runs out before I store it at the end of the season. Would recommend you avoid this model."
1,"Looked like a good idea, but this just doesn't work. Won't grip the arrows, then slips. Not worth returning, learn from my experience and save your money...."
2,I bought this for my mini e-revo. I am a little disappointed that the car will not fit on there with the tires on unless you put it on crooked(from corner to corner) It is a nice stand I dont regret buying as it does still work. I took some magnets and glued them to the bottom of the catch tray to help hold those small pesky nuts and bolts in place with out losing them.
1,"Seriously, don't waste your time on this. Even at $3.45, you would not get your shipping refunded right? Not to mention you will have to pay for shipping to send it back.Aside from the terrible odor that does not go away, it does not work. I laughed when I read another review that talked about the smell...... even if it had kept the combination I set, which it did not, the spread apart locking mechanism does not hold. Lucky for me that I was able to pull it out of the hole sine the combination I set did not work. It requires a tool to set the combo and it is not intuitive or easy at all, though it seems like an easy enough process. Anyway I set the combo, it seemed to take, then I stuck it in the computer and set it. After that the combination would not open the lock.......Warning Will Robinson..... Warning, Warning, BAD, BAD, BAD NEWS!!!"
2,"This book has divided the important topics into 5 sections. The book gives general and specific things to study and the practice test is pretty good. The only bad thing about the practice test is that it only gives 4 answer choices per question, while the actual test has 5 answer choices. The time it takes to take the actual test will be longer than it takes to do the practice test."
1,"I am glad to read all the reviews of this third part docudrama. I won't be purchasing The Last Full Measure. However, Civil War buffs like myself, should give a serious thought of purchasing two unknown gems entitled: Wicked Spring and Pharoah's Army. I bought both of them and I am not disapointed. They can be purchased here on Amazon."
2,This is the best movie I have ever seen. It allows us to think more clearly about the world's psychotic obsession with capitalism.
1,It brokeimmediately. Do not purchase!The materials are cheep and not worthy of purchasingBig disappointmentBuy something different
1,"The basic premise in this book is good - you don't need to punish your dog to train her, but it is a little off the wall sometimes. For example, the author suggests that your should play music for your dog while you are out of the house and leaving her alone (good suggestion), but then goes on to say that the best type of music to play is New Age. It also suggests not buying prepared food for your dog, instead feeding her raw food which is the only type to contain ""life energy"". I love my pets, but all of this goes a little too far for me. the only reason I don't send this book back is because it only cost $8 to begin with and would cost me $3 to send it back. For $5 I'll keep it and try to get past the tree hugging."
1,"Cheap construction, poor fit, and it rattles like crazy. It will serve the purpose, but it simply wasn't built for the abuse of staying on the back of a Wrangler. I'd spend a little more money for a better quality hitch step if I did it all over again."
1,"This product is inferior to say the least. I thought since it was a Cuisinart it would be a good product. I was solely wrong, I should have listened to the reviews on this one. This blender cannot do malts, smoothies, or anything for that matter. The lip on the end is terrible, everything ends up on the counter vs. the dish or cup you are trying to get the contents into. I figured since the original list price on it was $180, it would be high quality. STAY AWAY! This blender is worse than my $15 Walmart special. Returning this and will look into a Ninja instead."
1,Part ordered and sent was right number but wrong part new update cap is tan with white ring received tan with black ring call 254-582-2548 if you have any questions
1,"Just bought all three parts of the LOTR trilogy on CD. The reviews talked about how it was read by someone and it wasn't different actors or voices, etc. However, it is exactly that different actors reading the parts. It is not a person reading the book to you. I'm going to listen to it and then either sell it or gift it but I am very disappointed. Amazon needs to be careful in lumping together reviews of products that once existed with new ones and with different formats, etc. This is not acceptable."
1,"Beware, Grossman plays the songs on this dvd, but never shows you how to play them. The tab is so different from the way he plays the songs that you have to learn them by ear. Inaccurate tab seem to be the norm with Grossman's material. It's really too bad, because he's a great guitar player. I would love to sit down with Grossman and make him play these songs using the tab provided. Come on Stefan, buck up and proofread your material before you put it on the market."
2,"This book provides an excellent insight into a humble soul truly united with Christ. It's an inspiration to re-examine our own lives to see the how we can unite our sufferings with the Lord and allow Christ to work through us. It also reinforces the message of God's Divine Mercy and God's desire to shower us with His mercy when many may think we do not derserve it or even want it. While we can never merit God's mercy, He truly was working through St. Faustina to spread his message that he wants to give his Mercy to all who accept Him and to the whole world which is in so desperate need of Mercy. Reading this book will make you look at things differently and it is a grace to read."
1,"it seems to have been designed with a much wider bottle neck in mind, because it doesn't fit a standard one. it requires a huge effort to squeeze the sides together to cut the foil. buy a Screwpull - you'll be much happier."
2,"Koffi Olomide's Orchestre Quartier Latin's ""Force de Frappe"" retains the flavor that made the band famous. Recall the days of ""Magie,"" ""Andrada,"" ""Papa Plus"" and ""Noblesse Oblige,"" among others. The group's animations and instrumentation represents the best of African dance music. Although Koffi retains his original identity, clearly his current work shares a lot with other contemporary catchy dancable tunes popularized in Kinshasa and Paris. Latin Quartier's current work is fresh and is an indication that musically, the Congo has weathered the harsh realities of war to bring happinnes to many of us living far away from Africa. In ""Force De Frappe,"" Koffi has not let his fans down. An excellent adddition to African-Latin heritage!"
1,"These earrings were quite pricey for being ""simulated"" pearls. They were also a darker shade of champagne than what I expected them to be. I purchased these to wear to a wedding and now that I've seen them, I'm not sure that I'll even wear them. I was looking for something that appears ""classy"" but these appear somewhat ""gawdy"". I'm not impressed at all."
1,"The graphics on the game are good, and as a basic poker game it passes, but if you're looking to practice your skills with this game, it disappoints. All of the computer players stay in with basically any hand, regardless of the level of play. I've been beaten by too many Two-Eight off suits to mention."
2,This is a WOW book. It first analysis the way we think & then step by step it explains the changes that we need to incorporate. My Favourate chapters are Casual flow chart & matrix.
2,"This book is great for a beginner to get a first idea of what goes on behind the scenes to create different effects/qualities in photos, and as such, provides a good quick beginner's reference to put in your camera bag. However, I feel that this should be a companion to a more in-depth book, which goes into greater detail on subjects like exposure."
1,"I love the plain Zico coconut water, its pure not from concentrate, and its so delicious. I always buy the 33.8 pack of 6. This mango flavor was torture to finish! Save your money for the pure Zico coconut water which is so good it's addicting!"
2,"got it for my son whi is only 12,wanted something that would smell nice to not strong, he loves it"
2,"The pet stroller is so much fun! I strolled a 5K with my 13 year old scottie and we had such a great time! He loves the action but just can't walk that far anymore. The stroller was very easy to assemble, folds (fairly) flat for storage and transport, is tall enough that I do not have to stoop like with some baby unmbrella strollers and the wheels are large and agile enough to handle a variety of ""road"" conditions. It's terrific."
1,"Maybe the Poe fan might who knows nothing of the man or his work will find this to be of interest, but any prior knowledge of Poe and his works dooms this film."
1,"Leslie Howard tries really hard to play the early versions of the Paganini etudes on this CD but unfortunately just does not have the technique to pull it off. The playing comes off as slow, clumsy and most of all, unmusical. To get a better idea of what the earlier studies are suppose to sound like under the hands of a great technician, check out Nikolai Petrov's rendition:Nikolai Petrov Plays Works on Themes By Paganini."
2,"I've been practicing Pilates at home with videos/DVDs for several years, and have grown tired of most of the offerings available. It seems like they're all pretty much alike. However, I found this one to be a refreshing, and fun, change. There are 3 sections: arm work, a magic circle section that includes both leg and arm exercises, and a short section with your back body completely up against a wall. I especially liked the section using the Pilates magic circle (aka Pilates ring). You can tell the instructor really knows her stuff (and you're sure to like her cute little doggie, too!). Recommended for all Pilates enthusiasts who want something new to challenge them."
1,"I have read several Jude Deveraux books, and I can say that this is not only the worst Deveraux book I have ever read, but pretty much the worst book I have *ever* read. The writing is stilted and unnatural; the story contains none of the sass and romance that Deveraux's books usually do. Stick with the ""Highland"" series -- ""Highland Velvet,"" ""Highland Song,"" etc, and don't bother to pick this one up. It is so unlike any other Deveraux I have read that I cannot believe she wrote it -- and the copyright of ""Deveraux, Inc."" only helps confirm those fears."
2,I purchased these Valeo weights because I was very weak after spending 3 months in the hospital & 1 month in rehab. I use them on my legs & do a variety of leg workouts to strengthen my leg muscles. I like that you can remove some of the weight simply by opening a velcro closure & pulling it out but I find them a bit awkward to put on but once on they are not going anywhere! I recommend these to anyone who are looking to improve muscle tone in either their arms or legs.
2,This remake of Halloween by Rob Zombie actually is a good horror flick. It made me jump in a couple of scenes. For all that bad mouth it yes its a remake hollywood sometimes runs out of ideas. Though if you keep an open mind then you might end up liking the movie. As for myself I enjoy the movie just seem a little long. I thought maybe should have been maybe an hour and half not the two hours it ended up being. But I will try seeing the sequal and then make up my mind about whole remakes Zombie is doing. But if you love your horror movies and have an open mind to possiblity have liking this movie then watch it and see if you end up enjoying it. Most of my horror movies I have just for the blood and gore not for the plot lines.
2,"this is a good CD....nice, upbeat, and inspirational. The best tracks on this album are ""Bring It all back"" and ""Two in a Million"". Bring it all back is good because it offers encouraging words to those who are having problems believing in themselves. Two in a Million is good because it is about having someone in your life, who means so much to you, so much that you believe that you and that other person are just 'Two in a Million' with how good your relationship is. This is a great CD with quality pop songs, for the most part anyway. The last few tracks are kinda like filler songs, not very good, but for the most part the album is great for any pop music fan."
1,"Being a loyal follower of the McNally series, this one makes me miss Mr. Sanders even more. For the first time I struggled through an Archie adventure, not hanging on every word for a clever delivery, but hanging on until I reached the end. The beloved, well developed characters that Mr. Sanders brought to life on the pages of his novels have lost their zest. The chemistry and sizzle between Archie & Connie have fizzled. The Pettibones take a back-seat, as do the Olson's. We can only hope the series continues.....with a different ghost writer or Mr. Lardo tries a little harder to regain the Sanders' touch."
2,"I have used this case for over a year and a half to swim laps and I love it. Each time I use it I swim for over a mile freestyle, so yes it works for an active swimmer with their head fully in the water. The headphones are not perfect, you will sometimes get air pockets which makes the sound go in and out a little when you turn your head, but overall they work. I am able to listen to tunes while swimming laps, same as if I was running. The arm sleeve is the only disapointment, it does not adjust small enough for my arm (I'm small but not that small and it would have to adjust 2 inches smaller - only a massive body builder could use the arm sleeve). I just clip the case on the back of my suit and it works, but I would like to have the armband work."
1,"I was very disappointed by this book. I was looking for something that would provide creative ideas for projects/activities for either my 2 year old or my 9 year old. For example, # 217 When you drive past a cornfield, go slowly to admire their beauty and think about the hard work that went into growing the cornstalks."" My 9 year old could care less and my 2 year old would be interested for about 2 minutes. At what age would that be interesting to a child????"
1,Just an ordinary collection of young Japanese people in face or body shots wearing ordinary everyday street clothes. Very few nude or provocative shots. Was this someone's first intermediate school photo project? I am going to delete Nan Goldin's name from my hard drive.
2,"Like the Mickey Mote...only drawback is that you have to have a DVD player. Grandson runs DVD's through his playstation in his bedroom so the only place he can use the Mickey Mote is in the living room. But it is very cool, just wish he could use it in his bedroom."
1,"The Kindle is a great concept. The lack of back up for subscription content is definitely a con. As is the weight. But the worst con of all is: Why are the electronic books so expensive?? The average paperback is only $7. That is with all the materials, shipping, etc... costs. An ebook is only digital data sent directly to the Kindle unit. Why is it $10+ a book?? I would much rather go to Barnes and Nobles and pick up a paperback. No back up issues and much cheaper. Until this is ironed out, no Kindle for me.."
2,I loved this book because it gave me a gentle introduction to the hardships of chinese culture. The descriptions of foot bindings were so painful but enlightening. China has always been such a mystery to most of us.
1,"This study guide is the worst, some of the chapters don't match with the book, and there are very few quizzes, it just wants you to write the textbook over again in the guide."
1,"I ordered this recipe book in Dec. 2005, 4 months later I am still waiting for it. It was delayed shipment by Amazon.com 4 times, until I finally cancelled the order 4/22/06 when Amazon.com delayyed the order again until June 2006. They still do not know if they will get a shipment in. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ORDERING THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"I don't know how this product is because it supposedly left the warehouse on August 7th and it's August 17th and nothing yet. USPS said it was ""misrouted by the shipper"" so who knows when I'll receive this movie. It's a birthday gift for a girlfriend of mine for August 26th. I just hope I get it in time!There is no phone number to contact Amazon.com either..."
1,"that's all....a very disappointing movie. The plot was all over the place, the animation seemed lacking, it honestly reminded me of a family guy/ aqua teen show.....not in the good way. Futurama was one of the best, creatively ingenious animated shows I've ever watched. And now......wow, that was disappointing"
2,"I have made this stove - without the nifty legs - from a couple of aluminum beer cans. That was a fiddly solution to a simple problem. This, however, is not fiddly, and absolutely bombproof. I got it with the ti-lite mug, and if what you're looking for is something to cook Ramen with on the Appalachian Trail so that you can make all your friends go Oooooooooo, this is the stove for you. Which is kind of mean-spirited, because this stove works well. The legs are stout, the stove is light but gives the impression of indestructability.I take away one star because if you don't have a small-ish pot (e.g. the abovementioned ti-lite mug), this is not the stove for you, so much. Plus adding alcohol to a hot stove is not everyone's idea of fun. If space weren't an issue for me, I would probably have gotten a Whisperlite Internationale. But I have one of those, and got this instead. For the purpose, it's a great little stove."
2,"I began reading my copy of Alongside Night when I got home from the office, and couldn't put it down until I finished a few hours later. J. Neil Schulman's tale, written back in the 70s, reads well today; it could be our near future, what with all the trillions being created out of thin air this past year.I'd love to see a followup describing the beginnings of the Agorist Cadre."
2,"Some good songs, some so-so. Jennifer Knapp is great. I like the Newsboys remix, too. Check out the artists and make sure you like most of them."
1,"the fact that it still says this book was based on a real diary seriously bugs me. you cant pity the main character, shes just plain out dumb.. i bought this book tonight and im almost done with it.. i think i'm gonna go return it tomorrow or give it away, its just something not really worth reading"
1,"I had an HP Printer that held up for 4 years of undergrad and one of law school before I decided to replace it (worked fine, just was a bit slow). Since I had such good luck with my last HP (5 years of printing) I thought I would get this model. I have been consistantly disappointed with it ever since. It constantly reports that it is out of paper when it is not, routinely pulls in 2 sheets at a time, reports paper jams when there is no paper in it, and has lately taken to saying that the ink cartridge can't move, which also isn't true since just turning the thing off and on fixes that problem. Whatever you do, don't buy this printer, if possible I would give it 0 stars."
1,You can go backstage.Thats the closest to a compliment I can give for this waste of putrid... [feces](dooke)that electronic arts has deemed a video game!All the rest of the game is awful!The controls are slow and out of place and the characters look like gorrillas rather than wrestlers!And then the energy system ruins the gameplay.And the graphics are blocky and just plain... [butt]-ugly!I could go on forever!Get WWF No Mercy or WCW Revenge if you want a good wrestling game.This game sucks.Dont get it or you will be sorry!
2,"Sturdy, works well, cheap. Long as hell. Don't Buy 50+$ ones from best buy works just as well and you'll save some mean cash"
2,"Really like it,may have to make some adjustments in order to get it to work with your particular TV brand. Had to drill holes bigger in mount plate."
1,"I think everyone else has said it well! It didn't have lots of reviews when I bought it and got swindled in by the cheap price! I just spent an hour trying to pick all the feathers out of my mattress, sheets and blankets! It looked like a duck exploded on my bed when I took the featherbed off! Needless to say, this is going on my curb come trashday!"
1,"This Book is too Outdated.Buy this Book Instead ""The Complete Guide To Home Wiring""This Book is 2oo Times Better Then Wiring Simplified."
2,"Ms. Auerbach takes the reader back to the Victorian ages through the medias of art and literature to examine the image of the female during the period. She portrays the image of the female as ""Mythic"" - that is, as very broad and also very powerful, effecting the entire age and the ages to come. She discusses such works as Svengali, The New Magdalen, and the artistic works of Rossetti. Her thesis is basically that during the Victorian Era there was a sort of ""crisis of faith,"" and the image of the woman stepped up to replace the ideas held by religions, thereby becoming angelic or demonic. The book is well written, thought provoking and informitive in its presentation."
2,I bought this album to replace the original vinyl album from long ago which was passed on to my oldest son's collection. Very happy to recapture my enjoyment of their great music.
2,"I have bought this classic Christmas show three times (VHS,DVD twice!) and I would have to say the 50th anniversay edition is the version to buy. The first thing I noticed was that the Grinch is green, the color he is supposed to be. An earlier DVD had him looking mustard yellow. :-( The print and transfer are very good and there are some cool extras, including 'Horton Hears a Who'. ""You're a mean one""............:-b"
2,"I've only done the full yoga segment so far but I really liked it. She does a great job of cueing you through the poses and giving great instructions to ensure your form is correct. She also instructs on how to move from 1 pose to another so that particular aspect is good for beginners. My only complaint is that I wish it did go faster. She does take a bit of time getting from 1 pose to another so your heart doesn't get going too much. Even the sun salutations are rather slow so that doesn't get the heart rate up. But the routine is good and she intersperses spinal twists throughout the workout and she has some different poses so it's not just ""same old/same old"". If your upper body strength isn't great or you have any shoulder issues, this is good because she doesn't do a lot of 1 arm balances or excessive sun salutations."
1,"No matter what the company says, the device will not work in Windows 7. Yes they have drivers and no they do not work. After an hour tech support will finally admit that the drivers are frantically being re-worked because the current ones fail. Why didn't they admit that before I spent the hundred bucks? I guess they wanted the hundred bucks more.Read what others are saying: IT DOES NOT WORK."
2,"Gave this to my husband as one of his Christmas gift. He fell in love instantly. He never expected that a gas grill could give this much nice flavor to a steak. We've grilled all kinds of meat, fish, and vegetables with it. No problem at all. It also works out great with my ceramic pot to make stew and soup."
2,Dr. Michael Savage has hit another home run with this provocative book of his no-nonsense expression of conservative ideas. Dr. Savage does not apologize for his concrete conservative stance on the important issues facing our nation today. If only the vast expanse of our liberal college campuses would begin to expose our next generation to some of this truth serum...
1,Item installed in '05 Dodge Ram 1500. It would only work in one not so conveinient spot on the steering wheel. It also will not work if there is direct sunlight on the receiver. BE PREPARED for possible disapointment. I was.
1,"Finally read the book after having it far so long and now I know why. It was boring. The book has 39 chapter and it doesn't get interesting until the 30th chapter when Victoria falls for a man that came to Pandora's, Victoria quits her job, you know the ending. I could never get in to it."
1,"To read this book you have to first believe its methods work, which they don't because women are on the look out for guys who just want sex. Second, you have to be interested in just scoring. If you pass those two tests, then by pass the book because it won't help. Like does somebody really have to tell me women like flowers and I should show up with a clean car? This is major advice? And like women aren't gonna see through the lame plots they give you to score. The book goes on and on but says nothing I did not already know from common sense. Skip it."
1,"I have read a few Thomas Cook book. I got hooked on ever since I read ""Places in the dark"". However, this book was a complete waste of time. I ended the book hoping the next chapter would bring some intrigue, something that never came. You can get the audience hooked by saying ""I saw a murder last night"" and then end the story by saying it was on TV. I hope you see where I am getting at...No real plot, an avalanche of F*** words, zero literally work and an absolute waste of time and money. I would not advise users reading this book. Cook is a far better writer for such a disastrous book."
1,"Dated and should be replaced. This series when it first came out were good, but todays standards, no."
2,"I had been searching for a good corded phone and didn't think they existed anymore. I love this phone. It looks great and works great. I haven't had any problems with the cordless. The only thing I don't like is that the cordless doesn't show the strength of the battery charge. On my other cordless phones, I know exactly when to charge them because it shows how high or low the charge is. I wish this one had that. Other than that, I love this set!"
1,"I've always enjoyed watching Jeremy Northam's work, whether in the sci fi classic MIMIC or the oh so proper GOSFORD PARK. But not even the usually suave Northam can save CYPHER from being a cinematic mess. It's premise of corporate espionage and it's mysterious underlying theme is initially intriguing and holds your interest, even though it's slow moving. But as the movie throws twist upon twist and never really validates these twists, it becomes more of an incomplete jigsaw puzzle than a complete movie. Lucy Liu struggles through a role that requires her to look seductive, but whose monotonous delivery negates any impact the actress could have. Although stylishly done, CYPHER is one of those movies you should be glad you rented and didn't buy."
2,"We got this for my daughter (5) for Christmas and she loves it. I got it when it was on sale for cheap,cheap. I would have never brought it if it was $90. The stickers that came with it was a little pain but nothing like I have had to do in the past with other toys. It is very easy to set up comes in 2 pieces. The horse and carriage along with the dolls are beautiful!!!."
1,"I really wanted to like this movie. I knew it was a lower budget productiuon and I also understand that the short book of Ruth isn't much material to make a full length movie. And to be fair, they did a good job of not straying too far from the Biblical text.However, the acting is weak and the script worse, really bad at points. Dan Haggerty is the only one who can deliver a line and he has just a few. The characters all look like the came from Iowa, not the Middle East. Little things like all the clothes looking brand new and clean make it look more like a Sunday school play than a modern period piece.With a little better directing and a few different actors, this could have been pretty good. Don't expect too much and you won't be too disappointed."
2,"We love this tea! My sister rationed out her last remaining boxes; she just finished last year(2010)! We use so many Celestial Seasonings products. Almond Sunset and Roastaroma are my favorites, and there are no competing brands making anything similar. The day they bring back Almond Sunset, I'll go buy a case of it!"
2,"I am two-thirds of the way through this book and have found it to be excellent (so far) in all but one regard: The paucity of maps is infuriating. While there are some maps (a handful), few of them show significant details which Goulden writes about. Time and again, I have had to resort to the few maps provided to try and guess where the action is taking place and where the armies and units are arrayed. Other than that, I have few criticisms to this point (but will reserve final judgment until I finish the book)."
2,"This CD is great. It is so nice to hear progressive music of this caliber in the year 2002. Of course, you will never here this great music on any of your local radio stations. Most listeners wouldn't get the music. These guys are keeping the jazz/fusion field of music alive and well. All songs are instrumental. It is amazing how just 3 guys can create such a full sound. Shawn Lane keeps everything colorful with his amazing guitar playing, while Jonas and Jeff keep a powerful steady groove going underneath it all. Music is a cross between Allan Holdsworth and Joe Satriani. All songs are live, which is also amazing considering how tight the music is. Do yourself a favor. If you really want some brand new progressive rock/fusion, buy this CD. You won't be disappointed. The only thing I didn't care for was the artwork on the cover."
1,"product was shipped quickly and everything looked good untill I used the bits and found several were not true and couldnt be used. Some of the ones with a hole in center for security torx, the hole wasn't in the center so I couldn't use them either. I don't bother a company fussing with them, I'm the consumer that just don't go back to them again. I would not have written a review normally, but Amazon bugged me thru my e-mail to write a review, bottom line is that I do not think very much of the product."
1,"the good news is, it's short. Poor Anita, we hardly know you anymore. This entry into the Anita Blake is big on sex and very very small on plot. I guess it's a novella, so I should not be making an issue about its length, but in addition to having few pages, this book has very little substance. I read it and felt like I hadn't really learned anything about Anita; or Micah, for that matter. I would so much more enjoy this series of books if Ms Hamilton could make the plots more interesting, reduce the gratuitous ""porn"" segments, describe more about Anita's work without slipping into metaphysical cliches, and, because this bothers me a LOT, get a better editor to avoid numerous misspellings and repetition of phrases. Because the Anita Blake books were SO interesting and entertaining at the beginning of the series, I hope that Ms Hamilton takes many reviewers' advice and change the direction in which that this series is going."
2,"Great product, fit the room keys + cash + IDs in it. Water tight and easy to open + close. Plastic is thick"
1,"Sorry to throw off the curve... but this book is long-winded and short on useful ideas. I say 'long-winded' because nearly half of the text consists of citations, most of which are unnecessary. Rather than making arguments, James presents passages that illustrate a point, a feeling, a sentiment, an idea(?). But what is clear is that you've just read nearly 600 pages that amount to nothing. No wonder Wittgenstein allegedly read this book over and over again. There's no point!"
1,"Not quite a 1 star item, but no more than two. I bought this as an only option after the 2005 hurricanes and used it occasionally to keep the trees in my yard trimmed and cutting up the branches I trim. This is a good short-term, temporary saw if that's what you need. Not too many hours after use, mine wouldn't stay running after it was warm. Checked the air filter and replaced the plug, and still nothing. Finally last year, after very light yearly use, it would no longer start. I even tried replacing all of the fuel hoses and filter with a kit I bought, but none of that worked. The old saying is true: Buy cheap, buy twice."
2,"Annette Funicello, Tommy Sands, Ray Bolger, Ed Wynn and Tommy Kirk are forever in my memory. This is a great film full of fun and joy. It is full of color, music and happiness. I loved it growing up and I still love today."
1,"I purchased a two-pack of these suction cup fender straps. I'm now down to one as the other is probably well on its way to the Atlantic Ocean about now (along with the fender). Thought it was a great idea, but it just didn't work out. I applied the suction cups to a clean, smooth (gel coat) surface, expecting it to hold... and it did, for about 15 minutes, then was gone. I removed the survivor and secured the fender the traditional way, with a line and cleat. To be fair, the water was pretty choppy due to a bunch of jet-skis creating unwelcome wakes. The boat was beating against the dock pretty good. But, a traditionally secured fender would have survived the punishment."
2,"RW Ridley's The Takers immediately pulls the reader in and doesn't let go. The action makes it appealing, but Ridley's crafted storytelling makes the book great. His voice flows smoothly from scene to scene, pulling the reader along through the eyes of Oz as he meets character after character, each capturing a dichotomy of realistic, human emotions. Readers are left with the good and bad in the human condition, struggling along the paths paved both for us and by us. In the end, the story rips us through a great quest appealing not only to adolescent readers but anyone who enjoys truly good writing. As a former 9th grade English teacher, I highly recommend this book. Ridley has a great future ahead of him!"
1,I had the T3 hairdryer for less than 4 weeks and it completely stopped working. This is my second T3 hairdryer. My first one lasted two years. It is disappointing since this was top rated in many magazines.
1,"I had previously purchase a minnesota fats corner cue rack from K-Mart. It was solid wood and very good quality but was flawed. The felt area for the cue balls was too close together and at the most you could only fit 14 or 15 balls on it. Since, the only reason I purchased the product was for storage of the balls and cue sticks this was unacceptable. I returned it and searched amazon where I found the mike massey rack.The Mike Massey rack is made of pressed board and is painted. I put my rack together on a soft surface and the paint chipped off the front edges exposing the black pressed board underneath. This product is flawed in that the paint does not adhere to it. This product is very poor quality. Only buy if you don't mind a little wear leaving it looking like it came from a thrift store or a garage sale."
2,I have been using this heart rate monitor for 1 month now and I have no complaints. My heart rate is always accurate (against the machines at the gym and taking my pulse manually) and the information on the wrist unit is easy to read.
2,"Lots of people have horrendous stories about going home for the holidays and the fallout that ensues. For many of us, the Holidays are the most stressful time of year. Laurie Notaro has the insight meld her internal narration with true bits of hilarity that only happen during the holidays. Self-professed as a ""non-intellectual"" (unlike her husband) and not one of the crazies that start talking to you in line at Safeway; Laurie Notaro is comfortable somewhere in the middle, watching Anna Nicole Smith with the same horror & facination you would a train wreck. She offers useful solutions to quandries like controlling the eldery from coming unhinged in public places, and would REAL SIMPLE magazine print her solution of what to do with those 4 pks of white cotton brief panties in their ""Things That Do Double Duty"" section. Laurie Notaro never disappoints. I love this woman! Her book was my favorite Christmas present this year."
1,"11 month old, steady on her feet was playing with this and the whole thing tipped forward, bending her neck far back, smacking her face on an edge on the bottom, and banging her shins into the back bar. She was screaming inconsolably, is nursing one leg and probably has whiplash."
2,The media keyboard makes life so much easier. It is not so easy to type with the PS3 controller. With the keyboard it is a breeze. This item is a very terrific idea!
1,My baby has KP and this product did not improve his condition at all. at least it did not worsen them. I am moving on to find a better solution for my baby.
1,"Just listened to ""Soulful"" and have to say that Ruben has lost his way. I was a huge Ruben fan watching American Idol 2 and was hoping to hear that voice on his CD, but this is totally different. I hardly recognized him in these hip-hop songs. If this is the direction Ruben wants to go, then I won't be going with him! Bring back the sounds of ""A Whole New World"". Thumbs down to ""Soulful""!"
2,"I think that this book is better than chocolate. I really got into the book. Once I start I could not put it down. The book really speaks to young people. If you are a outcast or a new kid you can related to the character. Also it shows that there is always someone that you can turn to, you should never be scaried to tell someone what happend to you. It was one of the best books that I have ever read....I think that everyone teenager should read this book."
2,It is a accurate and easy to use. It is easy to own wuth a very reasonable cost of ownership.
2,"I bought this burner about a year ago and have used it 2-3 times a week in my office to cook dinner when I work late. What I generally make is sauted onions, mushrooms and diced chicken breast or beef or a 3 egg omelet.It cooks a little slower than my stove top at home and the controls are not very responsive. Basically it cooks on high, med, or low. There's not much in-between even though the knob makes you think there is. But it's good enough that I have no problems making good looking and tasting food.When this one quits I'll buy another one because it's so cheap."
1,"Okay, so I watched this movie last night, and I had no idea what I was watching.A kid is bullied at school, this strange little girl visits him at night and says she can't be his friend because, ""That's just the way it is."" Okay, but who is she? Why does the kid care?Then there's this guy going around killing random people and stealing their blood. Then we find out the little girl is a vampire. I honestly didn't know what was going on, I didn't know any of the character's names and it was just confusing to me. Why was this movie made? It should have been 3 different movies. One about the vampire little girl, one about the kid and his problems at school, and one about the serial killer.I turned it off after 35 minutes and watched something else. I just can't recommend it to anyone."
1,I had read an article out of an excercise magazine and it had a section of the book in the article. Who knew I read the best part of the book. I barely thumbed through this and am very disappointed with the thing. Most of the people the author describes in the book are not everyday women with real lives. If I was a model or fitness instructor of course I would be thin when I would get paid to work out etc. Don't waste your time.
2,"To tell the truth, I actually got the 5-pack of the cdr's, but i was very happy with them, where they may not have very much space on them, they are still very cool."
1,"I would give this book NO stars, but that's not a selection. I would never have finished it, except my book club selected it. Actually, I wouldn't have even opened it after reading the book jacket--flowery fables of realizing your dreams are not my cup of tea."
1,"Overall a poor piece of furniture.The exposed wood is as it appears: very nice. Our cherry finish matched the cherry finish of our crib (a Da Vinci product as well, and one I'm very pleased with).However, buyer beware. This piece of furniture contains lots of particle board and cheap pine. So not only will you have a difficult time putting it together, you might not get it put together at all. The pieces of wood we received for the drawers are terrible--black spots and cracks abounded. And only two cam bolts hold in the front of the drawers, hardly enough support for these pieces. Because the holes were poorly drilled and the cam locks were bad, I couldn't get two of the three drawers properly assembled. I had to use wood glue just to attach the front. I shouldn't have to do that for $250+."
2,Other reviewers have written detailed reviews of this wonderful novel but I wanted to add my praise. I fell in along side these characters and shared their joys and pains. Justin Cronin is a great writer and this is a great work. I'm glad I found this gem!
1,"This was the biggest waste of our money. I don't know what the solution is, but this trap is not it. The so called ""spikes"" are not sharp enough to even penetrate my hand when triggered, much less something as small as a mole. When you pull the trap up, you don't know if you got the mole, because, unless you plan on digging up your yard to see if the mole might be there, you don't know. We emailed the moleman, and he said that we needed to stick a piece of wood under the trap so that when the ""spikes"" come down, they do not just trap the mole. So the past 6 times this trap has gone off, we have caught the mole, only to pull the trap out and set him free. No where on the box or in the directions does it state the detail that needs to be taken. I say, either live with em, or hire a professional. Or, MOVE!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Ok, I absolutely didn't hate this movie. It was pretty much what I expected. But, I've found most of Rogen's movies to be subpar. He's a likeable oaf but not enough to carry a movie. His best performances were his smaller roles in Superbad and Fanboys. The guy literally has no screen presence. We all know Hollywood is grasping at straws these days. This is just another example."
2,My ten year old daugther is making great use out of the Franklin HW 216. In the car on the way to school she can easily review her spelling words. The big display is great for easy spell checking and the hangman game helps with the spelling too. The problem with the device is that it is very difficult to get the very small philips head screw out of the battery lid so that the four AAA bateries can be installed. I ended after almost an hour of trying opitcal screw drivers having to drill out the screw with a fine drill. Franklin customer service says this is a problem that they are aware of and hope to re-design the battery compartment in the future.
1,Hope I'm still alive to upgrade my fuzzy VHS to DVD.Looks like it won't be released until pigs have wings...
1,I got one for christmas and it is one of the worst cars i have had I have went through two motors the last one i got and ran it twice and it would not work so I called traxxas and they sent me a new one and they didn't say sorry or anything they acted like they didn't even care. they don't even want to make there costumers happy I will not ever buy another traxxas product again just becouse of the rustler and there support when i called them. and the car is not all that great the battery charger takes eight hours to charge which is terrable because poeple don't want to wait eight hours to play with the car. they make the car out of very cheap materials and they want you to have to buy a faster charger becouse they know that most people are going to buy a faster charger.
2,"I remeber when i was younger my dad had this collection. It was one of the only cd's he actually owned. He would alway play it like, every time we were in the car and at first I hated it. But now after a few years i decided to look up Jackson Browne and I love it. All the songs. Songs like The road out/stay are marvelous masterpeices. I could name many of my favorites but that's up to you. anyway i like it at least..."
2,Jedi Search was the very first SW novel I read and WOW! It astounded me! It starts out kinda dull but keep going for a couple of chapters and you can't put it down. KJA's story never has a dull moment or slip up that affects the plot. Truly KJA has outdone himself in a tale worthy of being A Star Wars novel.
2,"I don't know what you guys are talking about I thought this book was great just like the others. Oh and it did say why Jen and Sam were there, you just must have been reading to fast."
2,"The Good Dog by Avi is a sweet and loving story of a Malamute named McKinley and his ""human pup,"" Jack. McKinley is the head of the dog pack in Steamboat Springs. There is one dog in particular, named Duchess, that is not being treated nicely by her owner Pycraft. She runs off an McKinley tries to find her. He manages to find her, but not only does he find her, but also a wolf by the name of Lupin. She says that her wolf pack's numbers are low and she needs dogs to come join her.Will McKinley go off with Lupin and leave behind his pack and Jack? What happens to Duchess? What else happens in this wonderful book? That's for you to find out!"
2,"This is a good second book for those already familar with constructing basic RC (radio control) flying models out of foam and are ready to expand their knowledge and construction skills. The author discusses how to construct and use hot wire cutters (HWC) for foam commonly used for RC aircraft. He also reviews other details needed for successful design of flying models and how to expand the building skills needed for basic and advanced model types. The model aircraft addressed include RC models with motors and gliders. The information about properly ""skinning"" and repairing a foam wing or fuselage is well worth the purchase price."
2,"Joe Bonamassa is a blue/rock musical phenomenon that is awe-inspiring to anyone who will take the time to listen to his music. In his musical style/class, I would count him the second greatest musician on the planet - with Walter Trout weighing in first place. As you can easily see from all of the other reviews, I believe that you will find this CD well worth purchasing - as I have found all his material is. (After purchasing this item, I eventually went on to purchase everything he produced and haven't been disappointed.) As with any CD, you may not like all the selections but I believe the vast majority of his material you will. Among my favorites on this CD are: `Pack It Up', `You Upset Me Baby', and `Man of Many Words'. Bonamassa is an extraordinary adept and versatile musician. Since he is young and gifted, we can expect many more superb CD's in the future. Highly recommended."
1,"It was hard to follow, and didn't really have much to do with the past book. This author also made one of my favorite charecters, Boba Fett look really bad. It was the only book in the series that I didn't really enjoy. You will probably have to read it if you want to know what is going on in the series, but it won't be the most enjoyable time of your life. I got very bored of this book really fast."
1,"I felt this book had a good collection of recipes of all the foods we love - YES! So then I turned to my husband's favorite dish and found that the canh chua recipe was missing tamarind. Isn't that one of the key ingredients?? Turned off by this very one detail, I am returning my purchase."
2,This is my first book by Elizabeth Adler and I love it.It is a gripping story full of strong emotions. I wonder why it has not been spotted by any film producer to make into a movie. I'm sure your readers would enjoy it.
1,Does not hold Bluetooth securely. I lost a Plantronics 510 headset out of this carrying case. Wouldn't recommend this case to anyone.
1,"When I received this product in the mail, I was excited to have an easy to use travel alarm clock. However, when I tested the alarm, it wasn't any noisier than a pin dropping! Not too happy. I am returning the clock and hoping it was just a defect!"
1,"If you want a peek into a woman's mind who enjoys flights of submissive fantasy, you might like this book. Perhaps the author should consider writing romance novels featuring D/s themes.As I read I began to believe that the author is not particularly sexually sophisticated. Her distaste for and confused descriptions of oral and anal sex were odd notes for someone purporting to be well-versed in erotic submission.There were some jarring notes which set off alarm bells in my mind when dealing with her relationship with her Lord as well. I understand there is a sad lack of material written by submissive women for submissive women, but I do not think this book is a good introduction to the topic though it has provided fodder for discussion between my partner and myself. On that level it's a success, but that really isn't why I bought this book. Disappointing."
1,"It's been the rare music superstar who doesn't turn their hand to at least one movie, and Neil Diamond is no exception. ""The Jazz Singer"" is not a good film, either cinematically (Sir Laurence Olivier stated flat out that he did this one for the money) or musically (""Hello Again"" is pretty, but much of the rest of the soundtrack tries WAY too hard). Diamond has a deer-caught-in-the-headlights expression for much of the movie, except when he's singing. Olivier's over-the-top performance is a treat for cheese lovers, though, and Lucie Arnaz actually does a pretty good job. Overall, though, if you're not a Neil Diamond fan (and even if you are), this film is pretty tough going."
1,"Well the formula cheap=expensive works with this one, it says 16-17'' nevertheless it did not fit my 17'' monitor, on the other hand after 40 minutes it felt, the stickers just were a fake, just do not buy it."
1,"I bought this box set to give this series a second chance. Unfortunately, I found the series as dissapointing as I had when I was a child watching this on television.The show is quite funny, has Zelda for the most part being the boomerang-wielding heroine, though it isn't very serious as it is known the target audience is 6-9 year olds.The only reason I would recommend against this purchase is for the shows portrayl of Link. As a child playing the Legend of Zelda on the old NES system, it was unplesant to see our ""Legendary Green Hatted Hero"" as a semi plump, snort laughing, perverse womanizer with the tagline ""Excuse me, Princess!""This is a great buy if you're looking for some laughs and nostalgia, but if you're a hard core Zelda fan who has never seen this, and expect it to be a serious action show, you'll be in for a huge dissapointment."
2,"This made a very creamy, tart yogurt that I was generally pleased with...although since this was my first time making yogurt I think I might try some other brands to compare taste and consistency."
2,"This is the complete soundtrack toThe Rutles - All You Need Is Cashtelevision special. The special was a Beatles parody written by Eric Idle. The music was written by Neil Innes. The songs are very close approximations of Beatles songs, in fact, in most cases you can tell which Beatles song is being ""rewritten"". For example, ""Get Up and Go"" is so similar to ""Get Back"" that Innes could have been sued for plagiarism. The album is a lot of fun, but you probably need to see the TV special to fully appreciate it. Get this CD, it's the perfect Beatles ripoff! (and I mean that in a good way.)"
1,"At first it was soft, but after using it for 6 months it has started pilling. I use a front loading washer and wash it in hot water on the perm press setting--so it's not being treated roughly!"
1,"Reading this book was like watching paint dry. I don't think it's well written and the characters aren't compelling enough to even want to continue. A better alternative would be ""Memoirs of a Geisha."""
1,"As a foster for dogs and lover of animals, I immediately questioned the training techniques in this book. Near the beginning the trainer/psychic said a female dog would only get better if she had a litter of puppies. I almost puked. In a world of over population of dogs and cats this is a very OLD belief system. Therefore everything else I read was unbelievable. Tens of thousands of healthy dogs and cats are put to sleep in America alone because of overpopulation and people not spaying or nuetering. While I stumbled through the book I kept finding more things that made the lead character unbelievable. I won't be buying anymore of the Isabel Wolff books."
1,"2 1/2Although average, it is a consistent, high-brow mediocrity. The group continues to focus on production technique at the expense of creating memorable tunes, which initially brought them into the spotlight on their debut. Here, although consistently ""pleasant enough"" to suffice as background coffee shop fodder, barely anything sticks to memory and what does still comes up emotionally superficial."
1,"It is frustrating that one cannot rely on the product's information. The manufacturer's description states:""Strainers included"", yet the sink came without any strainers. The sink may be good such as, however it is desirable that one knows exactly what is being purchased and not to be unpleasantly surprised later. Therefore, my shopping experince with this product was not a positive one."
1,"Please . . . yet another book where someone name-drops and talks about down and dirty sex . . . and basically yet again USES people to get money and to be on the periphery of fame, and when she didn't get famous enough, didn't get rich enough, she figured, Let me write a book and milk my pathetic life some more. AND THEN, the most galling, is that in order to elevate herself somehow, she and the ghostwriter, and the publisher, tack on that it's a ""cautionary tale."" There's no caution here other than if you really want to redeem yourself as mother and human being, you'll shun the spotlight and work on your issues without doing it on center stage. Narcissism at its worst."
1,"If you can withstand the exceptionally boring presentation and unmotivating banter, then you will get a good workout. The setup is good, where you can choose whether you want to do upper body, lower body or your abs. But that's just the menu. Jackie is sarcastic and not amusing. Her motivation is limited to ""you can do anything for a minute"" and the guidance on perfect form is minimal in the workout portions. Even her trainers seem like they don't want to be there, so why would I want to do this workout ever again?I used this dvd a few times simply because it was a quick and effective workout, but the mind-numbing aspects have moved it to the bottom of my workout list."
1,"I'm huge fan of Lucias ! Loved ride the wind ,ghost warrior ,but she lost me on this one, couldn't get into the characters and the story line was boring ....I'll stick to her books on American Indians."
1,"I thought this was a great idea in theory, but it just didn't work at all. It did not remove anything from my skin. I steamed and rinsed with hot water beforehand to no effect. Very Sad."
2,"These lightweight maracas are beautiful and sophisticated enough for adults, yet manageable enough for small hands. One is higher-pitched than the other but they're about the same medium-low volume. The timbre produced by the natural wood is smooth and calming. My only complaint is that I wish they didn't each have a Basic Beat logo across the center (a detail I missed before ordering). A lovely gift for children from birth-100!"
1,"I began truly loving this book. I thought the language was beautiful, the magic realism combined with mexican-american cultural practices was magnificent. I can't believe people thought it was boring! But, I do have to say I was repeatedly bothered by the fact that this was supposed to be a 6-7 year old boy having these enlightening thoughts and concerns. Come on, when you're six you're worried about the monster under the bed not the bigger ramifications of 2 sides of the family, older brothers destroying the dreams of their parents and what are the secrets of the universe! At least bring the kid up to 11 or 12 to make it semi-realistic. That really ruined it for me! and his bud Cico (sp?) he was supposed to be, like 8, and he was like a wise old guru spouting truths and gems of wisdom (In third grade!!)"
2,"I think Paul Simon is one of the greatest song writers ever, but on this piece of work he really outdoes himself. The controversial subject matter (a real life story of a fifties NY gang member killing two boys and being sentenced to death penalty, eventually converted into imprisonment for life) is handled with subtlety, without prejudice. It's a good attempt to make you think from the killer's point of view, to see how he came to his awful deed, without trying to make him a hero, without glorification of crime.The crew on this album (Paul Simon doesn't sing on every tune) is just amazing: the voices, the inspiration, the pleasure... it all just pours from your loudspeakers, with a solid backbone of a beefy horn section here, or just Paul Simon's guitar there.Definitely not a typical 'Paul Simon' album, but a very good album with great songs written by Paul Simon and great performances (sometimes by Paul Simon)."
1,"The Specs of the Machine that is being sold is not the same specs as in the title. I.E. it read 2.6 Ghz, but when you go to the item descript it will read 2.4 ghz. Just double check, don't depend on the the title, of the item from this company. Look closely at the specs..Item works fine, shipped quickly."
1,"Kidz bop, actually, ALL the kidz bops suck. They turned ""peices of me"" by ashlee simpson into ""peices of CRAP"" it was like the reverse of King Mitus: everything the Kidz Bop Kidz sing turns to garbage. I actually liked the songs they sung before. I repeat:BEFORE. Or atleast before Kidz Bop sang it. They messed up pretty much every song and gave that songwriter a bad name. this CD sux you are better off listening to Radio Disney. When I heard my cousin's Kidz Bop CD, I was laughing sooo hard, I could hardly breath afterwards. However, this song is good for the little children who want to here current music, but their oarents wont let them get a certain CD because it has a parental advisory sign on it. EVER HEARD OF A CLEAN VERSION???!!!so i DONT suggest this CD to ANYONE."
2,Leslie Meier has done it again with this holiday story. The one thing I suggest is that you should read them in the order she wrote them because you see the characters grow in these stories. I did not read them in the right order but I still loves her books
1,"Received 2 containers, both contained minimum of 2 oz of cream. One container completely useless as it is clogged with ""old"" cream. Other container works fine, but cream does not appear to work any better than over-the-counter cream used for same purpose."
1,"If this is what historical romance is about, I've had enough. The author's idea of challenge for her protagonists usually involves sexual assault. I unfortunately ordered this second novel in the series before I had read the first one (""Outlander"") on a recommendation. That book indulges in equal-opportunity sadism as a device for drawing her hero and heroine together. The distasteful voyeurism was startling to me and quite offensive. This sequel appears to be much more involved in historical events, but about halfway through the same victimizing tropes appear. All I can say is, ugh."
1,"This is easily the worst of the 20 episodes in this series; to begin with, it doesn't contain any newsreel footage as the name implies, and by ""early years"" it goes back to 1914. The first sections of this episode consist of footage of World War I with some sound dubbed in and a very boring and superficial commentary by the narrator of this series. We then get large chunks of a post-WW II documentary on the Nazis to explain the chaos of Weimar Germany and what led to Hitler's seizure of power. We then progress to edited sections of ""Triumph of the Will,"" and that's basically it. Even the edits from the latter film were chosen badly, as they could've selected some of those that showed the brutal force that lay at the heart of Nazism but didn't (the marchpast of the SS in Nuremberg at the end of the film, for example). I would only buy this episode if you were buying the set of the first five episodes, otherwise, it's not worth the money."
1,"This has to be one of the worst books ever written. I spent almost $30.00 on this book and felt totally ripped off. Brad Knight speculates on what he felt like happened to Laci, and why Scott did it, etc. I don't care what he ""speculates"" happened to Laci, I want facts and there wasn't any given in this book. He then goes on to bore us about his take on the O.J. Simpson murder case (as if this has anything to do with the Peterson case-don't ask.) He rambles on and on about his theories on both of these cases, but his theories are based on speculation, rumors, etc. The fact the title of the book is ""Laci Peterson: The Whole Story"" is a joke...the book ends even before the trial. He is supposedly going to write a second book to finish where the first book ended...boy, that's one book I won't be buying. If you want to read the definitive book on the Laci Peterson murder case read Catherine Crier's great book, ""A Deadly Game""."
1,"This would be a great kids film, except the writers just HAD to put scenes with alcohol in it. One of the twins samples wine, the mother shows up drunk at the hotel, vodka is mentioned, please! This is a KIDS movie, why do they need to put that in there? I think I'll pass on buying this for that reason alone!"
1,"I received this book as a holiday gift and was so excited to begin reading it. Boy, was I disappointed. I must confess I barely made it past the first 100 pages. Bogle's efforts to include every single tidbit of information he researched actually succeeded in doing the impossible: making Dorothy Dandridge a boring subject. I hope to get back to the book one day and plow through it because Dandridge has always fascinated me but I'm not making any promises. I hope one day either a different author or Bogle himself will go through this book with a big blue pencil and edit this monster down to a reasonable, and interesting, size."
1,"Stay away, do not buy, total waste of money. The only good thing that I could say is that the shipping was fast."
2,"Interesting, somewhat original take on the marooned alien on earth genre. the movie is fast paced the special fx are mind blowing! Can't wait to see part 2."
2,"Super delicious movie theatre style popcorn. Super easy to make open the package, pop and then eat! It's that simple."
2,"I would have to strongly disagree with any nay sayers on this book. I loved it as much, if not more than the previous two Kenzie and Gennaro books. Lehane writes believeable, and very often funny as well as smart-ass dialogue that I get a big kick out of. The plot here has twist after twist, it's as Kenzie and Gennaro find out, up is down, down is up, black is white and white is black. Thank you Dennis for moving Patrick and Angela in the right direction (towards each other), I hope they continue. Lehane's books are not tame, and if you have a problem with violence these may not be for you, I happen to think they are completely engrossing.Ree-views"
1,"Add me to the list that received a defective machine. I really like the style and the features of this machine. However, after a couple of loaves didn't turn out well, I finally realized that the pan just wasn't hot when I pulled it out of the machine. Amazon made it very easy to return, but I decided to buy a machine locally instead of ordering online again. I bought the Cuisinart CBK-200 2-Pound Convection Automatic Bread Maker. My first one burned the loaves, so it went back to the store. My second one has been working well for a couple of months now. I wish quality control was better for appliances like these."
1,"I thought this might be a pretty good straight to DVD action movie but I was wrong! I mainly watched it because of Bas Rutten(UFC Champion,BlackBelt Magazine ranks him as the world's greatest martial artist) He didn't show up until the last showdown match of the movie and didn't say a word,but he did fight well. This is a movie you just fast forward a lot until you get to a fight scene, which was okay if you like wire work (I don't really look for an oscar type of performance in an action movie but the acting in this movie was Terrible!) Do yourself a favour rent ""Belly of the Beast"" by Steven Seagal I'm sure you won't be pushing that forward!"
2,"This Cd is not only the Extremes of tori It's also one of Tori's most sensitive work. She portrays an amazing music talent like she allways does. This CD will live forever.. I love her work so much I bought one CD for my car and one for my sterio.. An outstanding talent, buy Boy's For Pele' now."
1,"The story is fairly typical, but the dialogue is stilted and unbelievable. There are few surprises, and the characters are forced down your throat with ham-handed attempts at empathic situations which end up making you indifferent to their fates.Also, this book was edited by an illiterate person. There are numerous misspellings and the grammar in several parts is extremely sloppy."
1,"I wasn't sure what to expect for a ""senior item,"" but the only thing I see different is that they are for a person with extra large knees. I'm a woman, 5'11"" and these knee pads are a tad too large for my knees. I live overseas so didn't have much choice. I needed them right away so had them made smaller by a seamstress. They are fine now....but, only get them if your knees are a bit larger than ""normal."""
2,"Get the full set, because this is simply the best complete studio recording of ""La Traviata"". The 3 ""giants"" (Scotto, Kraus, Bruson) all have many years of stage experience in their respective roles and transform the performance into a real theater experience. Kraus and Bruson are excellent as always, and much better than the partners of the younger Scotto on the recording directed by Votto. The recording was made in the late 70's (early 80's ?), so one should be aware of the condition of Scotto's voice at this late stage of her career, but the prima donna's musicality and artistry compensate greatly for any vocal frailty. Forget the ""lovely"" Cotrubas, Studer, Gheorghiu : Scotto's Violetta is flesh and blood and will really bring tears to your eyes."
1,"I agree that this material was enough for a magazine article, no more. I guess we're to see more of this over-inflated article-into-book stuff. Oh well. Winchester is a thick, witless writer who needs to take better care with his use of words."
2,"This is a great idea and works well with both cork and those synthetic stoppers.....But,,,the battery is very weak and will open only one bottle at time before it needs to be recharged.....You have to recharge it after opening every bottle.....I was going to buy these for presents,,but decided not to because of the hassle of the frequent recharging...If you only need to open 1 bottle at a time and can wait several hours until the battery recharges then buy this item...."
1,"Towels were just warm in spots, not what I expected, I have returned the product for a refund,Amazon makes the return process very easy!"
1,"Ms. Foster introduces several romance themes into this book, but none of them work. First, the idea of a tough female mercenary leading a daring rescue in Central America is a good idea; but Ray isn't so tough except for knowing some martial arts and the rescue isn't very dangerous. Ray and Eli just fly in, grab Eli's brother, and fly out. The only tension is sexual, wondering when and where it would finally happen. Second, we already know from the cover of the book (notice the stork) that Ray turns up pregnant, which I don't mind in a story; but it was not ""unexpected."" Third (and last), we head on out to the ranch at the end. It is too little and too late to turn this one into a Western. Sorry, but I recommend avoiding this one entirely."
1,"i recently rented this game for my son and i immediatly took it back when i saw how much blood and gore there was. incredible. how can people play a game where you just kill people. also, since my sons brain is just developing these ideas of killing people would have affected his brain development if i hadnt taken it away sooner. all in all, this game teaches you to be a serial killer, and i believe that all the kids who play this game excessivly will turn out this way. DONT BY THIS GAME!"
1,"Hit the fast forward a few times, and stop at 11. Yes, 11 before stunning grooving ATTENTION. What a great track, it sort of sounds, perish the thought, some real musicians decided to get a grip of things. I love it. But the rest - its garbage really. Very disappointing. More fodder for the masses that know no better."
1,"Be prepared for a very strong odor -- like rotten eggs with strong cheap perfume. If you are willing to put up with the stench, the results are amazing."
2,"These bibs are perfect! They are easy to put on, and my son hasn't figured out how to rip them off yet. They catch all the food that doesn't make it into his mouth, and they're easy to clean! Plus he likes the picture of the teddy bear on the bibs!"
2,I remember watching this when I was a kid in the 60's To my knowledge there has not been a more complete and comprehensive series on WW1 since. I have seen documentaries over the years that that either dwell on the causes of the war or the bruitality of trench warfare or the new weapons that were either born out of the war or came of age during it. This series covers all these aspects and more. If you could only have one documentary searies on WW1 this should be it.
1,"I bought this book out of curiosity, because I am in interested in virtually everything that has to do with the Ligo facility and the other gravity wave detectors throughout the world. What a great disappointment. The author starts his book clamimig that gravity waves are no ripples in spacetime at all, but they are just like electromagnetic waves, waves that propagate THROUGH spacetime. Well, now this book rests where it belongs, in my trash can. As Einstein would say: Das ist absolut Blödsinn"" (This is TOTAL NONSENSE...).Stay away from this book. If it was a total waste of money."
1,"I have the previous all plastic case version of this tool. It has given good service since 1999. I wore out the second set of batteries and bought the 9966 because the batteries were compatible with my old tool.The new PC drill has been used maybe 10X. It looks near new. The gear box broke and it won't shift into low gear. The metal case also cracked by the gear shift.I used the heck out of the old tool and it still runs strong. This new replacement is a downgrade. The gear box should not break.Glad the new warranty is 3 years. Now hope it can be repaired.I would not buy one of these. After thinking about it, it seems a very stupid idea to use die cast or injection moulded metal in an application that is expected to receive impact loading such as a portable power tool."
2,"Nightfall in Mogadishu is a political thriller set in Somalia, which provides an interesting backdrop to the story of intrigue and murder. The main character, Susan, is a CIA agent working undercover at the World Bank, and throughout the novel she struggles to balance the responsibilities of these two roles, with her personal sense of right and wrong. Susan is a strong and determined character, and I would be interested in reading more novels featuring her.I didn't know much about the situation in Somalia before reading this book, but the author has worked there, and her knowledge of Mogadishu comes through on every page to make the story feel realistic. There's a lot of detail packed in to the book, but it doesn't slow the pace (which is fairly relentless)."
2,"Very interesting album, mixes well-produced pop with rougher moments,all embedded in great arrangements and good melodies."
2,Best coffee maker I have owned. The easy to remove water filter is great and not having to use basket filters gives a pure coffee taste.
1,"Puerile story, sophomoric prose. Thought Ted had it after reading the first chapter or so in the bookstore, but I was halfway through the novel before realizing this is pulpy nonsense. He does know how to stay with a character viewpoint though, so at least he has that over many of today's lousy authors including Grisham, Patterson, Cornwell, et al.How many of us have time for story content that is riddled with cliche after poorly drawn cliche, slow development, hacked and wooden characters, stilted dialogue? If you do, enjoy Ted Bell. I simply have another author to avoid. At least the list of great authors is getting smaller and easier: they are Scott Turow, Michael Robotham, Stephen King, Audrey Niffenegger, Thomas Harris. A few more. Not Ted Bell, though. Sorry."
2,"Dang, it's great to see this show again! There are very few animated shows that attempt to capture real life in a remotely intelligent way, and I haven't yet seen anyone do it more intelligently than Daria. Sure, lots of the individual characters are dim, shallow caricatures, but that's the point; aren't most of the people you know wasting their human potential, too? It's how Daria sees the world.It's a real shame that the originally aired music couldn't be included... maybe in 25 years, after all of the copyrights have run out, we'll get the full glory of the original. In the meantime, this is a great way to remember the 90s and/or your high school years."
1,"This wireless access point worked well for about 2 months, but then it started to turn itself off & on sporadically. LinkSys tech support tells me that this is a normal behavior -- the unit might work for 1 hour, and then off for the next few hours, then again, on & off. I thought they would just replace the unit (since it is under warranty), but they wouldn't... they transfer instead to their technical support in India or Philippines... & would not replace the device saying that ""when it doesn't work, it is a normal behavior..."""
1,"Tim Burton strikes out again in this inflated rip off of 1950's B Budget films that were actually quite more enjoyable and inventive. This is the shortcoming of Hollywood when a mediocre director gets a ton a money, desirable actors, and does nothing with it except give us cool looking, mischievous aliens that were theived from bubble gum cards. This is an agony to watch because nothing ever happens except a weird 'buzzing' sound that is actually a Theremin machine that was used in the classic sci-fi tradition. You are better served by watching 'War of the Worlds' for the 10th time again. Leave this stinker in the can."
2,"This is one of the best retold stories of Cinderella out there. The story is clear and one that students grades 2 - 4 would benefit from reading, both for enjoyment and to boost their reading skills. The illustrations are lighthearted, colorful and pleasant, contrasting with the somewhat forbidding and fearsome illustrators of other fairy tales. This makes the book even more appropriate reading for the younger child as throughout the story there is a more hopeful tendency towards Cinderella's eventual outcome. I'm definitely ordering a few for my second grade classroom."
1,The watch was received promptly and in good shape. However the battery was dead and i had to take it to a jewelery store to get it replaced.
2,I really recommend his books. I read them over and over again. This book in particular will change your life. But it for you or anybody you love.
2,"The service is Top Notch as well as the product...Amazon.com has made being a Pastor in ""The Country"" easy to get material and Study Guides...."
2,"Other reviewers have mentioned the similaties between ""Siesta"" and ""Jacob's Ladder."" I would also like to introduce ""Stay"" into that mix. I must admit that all the clues are clearly in place, but I didn't recognize the twist until the end. This film has got a tremendous cast with some actors merely in it for a few minutes. Martin Sheen comes to mind. Ellen Barkin is fetching in her red dress. And the franticness with which she plays her character is disturbing. ""Siesta"" would not work as well as it does if not for the work of Miles Davis/Marcus Miller."
1,"I've had the 7526 for almost two years now. The shave is average, but the cost of consumables has been what I feel is high. Besides the cleaning cartridges (at approx $4.50/ea), I've had to replace cutterheads twice in the two years. The foil wears through exposing the cutters making replacement necessary. Given their replacment cost, I figure they should last longer than 8 months..... I'd been a Norelco user for a long time prior to the Braun, and I'll soon be switching back...."
2,We own 3 of this product. The 4th went to Toys for tots xmas donation.This product has lasted through 5 grandchildren. They are still in great shapemy youngest grandson age 3 is just starting to pay with this product.I strongly advise to be used for 3 years and up. My 6 year old gradddaughter is still playing with these toys.All I can say is BUY THEM. You cannot go wrong.
2,Need...More...DBZ...VIDEOS This is the best video ever made i have watched this film 50 or more times.
1,"Zone 1 Francophones beware: the english subtitles are onthe video layer and cannot be turned off. I suppose thismight save the production cost of redoing subtitles forDVD, but it would be nice if this fact were mentioned inthe technical info. Completely unacceptable, hence theautomatic one-star rating."
2,"This is the one movie that made me burst into random tears! My sister and I watched this movie years ago. We lost it when she forgot him, yet again! I recommend this movie to everyone! I'm not even the romantic movie type, but this movie holds my heart!"
2,"This book is a gem! Read this book, my God, please read this book. Any woman, regardless of color, who has been mentally or physically abused will find great hope from this book. Bless you Ruthie. Your life has indeed blessed mine."
1,While there were all sorts of variations for connecting to the hose there was only one option for the nozzle.
1,"Totally unsatisfactory! First, to find that by ""reversible"" the manufacturer means only that one can mount it facing either way: second, to find one can NOT mount it either way in a sliding window, since one such direction places the adjustable shutter down, forbidding extending it."
2,The kids enjoyed it and that's all I care about. It's a great activity to do along with them... enjoy!
1,"I love John Irving books, really I do. He's one of my favorite authors. But this was just a really awful novel. The story has no likeable characters, the main character is boring and seems to learn nothing from his experiences, the women in the book want nothing more than the protagonist's ""seed"" so that they can impregnante themselves. No one seems believable, or sympathetic, or the least bit interesting. If this book were a party, you would be looking at your watch until you could leave. There were times when Irving himself seemed bored with his story -- rather than SHOW anything, he would just TELL huge chunks of the story, as if he wanted to skip ahead. I hope whatever caused Irving to write this book will go infect someone else instead -- I miss the great author he used to be."
2,I love the design of this watch. The only negative thing I have to say is that the watch stem and date window could be a little larger. Skagen watches are definately a winner for those who prefer a mid-size watch.
1,"Ugh, what happened here? The band really shows their creativity, yes, and have complexity, but the riffs...are GONE! WHOOSH! They're extinct! Metallica really have reached their low on this album. Gone are the great riffs, filled with jamming sessions. Not that that's bad. It's just the riffs that make Metallica. But, they do get better with the next album, Reload. I'm glad they aren't making stuff like this anymore."
1,PLEASE READ THIS!!!!!!!!!!! I've tried to order this set 4-5 times in the last few months both from Amazon and third party sellers/new and used and each time I received sets containing two disc#2's and no disc#1.There's a bad run of this thing out there and no one is checking on this.Be sure to contact a seller and ask specifically if disc#1 is PRESENT in the set before attempting to make a purchase.
1,"I enjoyed the first X-Men movie not only because it was so thrilling to see a live-action adaptation of a cherished comic book series, but also because it had a plot that made sense and it didn't go (too), over-the-top. The sequel, X-Men 2, was still very enjoyable because the plot was consistent to the end and the action sequences were not as overdone as MI:2. X-Men 3 was THOROUGHLY dissapointing for me because it tried so hard to pack in everything it could, to the detriment of the plot. I found myself wondering why this series of mismatched scenes were jumbled together when there should have been a very solid plotline to follow. Were we to focus on Jean Gray? Archangel? Magneto? What was the movie about other than an excuse to go WAY over-the-top on every sequence and barely work on character development. What a pity the last movie was so thrown together."
2,"These are very solid and snug fitting gloves. I really like them, and they seem well build. One thing to keep in mind is that the leather around the fingers is very strong and will take a while to be worked in. For the first few times of use, they will pinch your fingers, but eventually this will go away. I recommend these if you want to protect your hands from calluses."
2,"This is where the dark saga of the band previously known as Purgatory began. Iced Earth puts out some great songs on this album despite the bad vocals of Gene Adams and bad production (not as bad as Killing's my Business, but still...) I mean come on. Which guy told Gene Adams he could sing? Ugh. Anyway, true classics of metal are put out on this record. The namesake track, Colors, Life and Death, Funeral, and When The Night Falls are my favorite tracks. When the Night Falls is my favorite Iced Earth song by far and away, probably tied with Melancholy. For die hard Iced Earth fans,you already own this so why should I tell you to get it? For fans looking to get interested in the band, I recommend Dark Saga or Something Wicked before this one."
1,"Basically another boring sim game.you create a sim,make it do stuff,do boring goals,get a job...*yawn*Reeeaaaaaaaaaallllllllll boring stuff there.If your a sim fan I recomend you don`t get this one,it`s THE SAME THING AS ALL THE OTHER ONES!I don`t know how you like that crap!Oh well,buy it if you want,it`s a waste of $$$$ to me."
2,"In terms of quality, this is an excellent collection. Warrick has selected outstanding stories that cover a wide time span--enough from the founders to be substantial, and a great selection of mid-year sci fi (50s to 70s). Two of my favorite stories of all time are included (by Butler and Tiptree)--and these are ones hard to get anywhere else. But....you would be better off looking for one of David Hartwell's books, which offer more value."
1,"It's an alright movie. I've seen better vampire movies. I wouldn't waste my money buying this one. i bought it because of all the good reviews, but it's really not as good as people say it is. It's okay. i wouldn't watch it twice though. Just really sorry that i bought it."
1,"We could not keep this wall rack because the listed dimension in the online description and the product packaging is incorrect. It extends much further off the wall then the 4.5"" listed. Therefore the rack did not fit in the space intended. We're sad because it is a nice rack and would have helped us organize our mail and magazines."
1,"I am so surprised people liked this book! The advice was so obvious and simple--who doesn't know this? There was much useless info--how to organize your bathroom, don't spank your kids...what does that have to do with finances? I returned my copy because it was in poor condition but I would have tossed it anyway."
2,"Finally! A book about SMART, SAVVY, EFFICIENT and COST-CONSCIOUS investing for not just the super-rich, but for the typical affluent investor!As an independent financial and wealth advisor to many affluent (but not Super-Rich) clients, I have ALWAYS advocated utilizing investment strategies other than Mutual Funds.Mutual Funds are very costly, very inefficient, and typically underperform the market by a long shot. But where's the typical investor to turn?With ""Stop Wasting Your Wealth in Mutual Funds"" Don Wilkinson has written a very Consumer-friendly and informative guidebook on how the average investor can set up portfolio management in Separately Managed Accounts and get on the road to achieving much more success with their money.Definitely an eye-opener to the pitfalls of Mutual Funds, and to the positives of Separately Managed Accounts."
1,"This was one small toy for my son on Christmas, but it was one that he was looking forward too. Wound it up twice (4 turns each) and it stopped working on the 3rd use. Too bad, but I guess you get what you pay for."
1,"I don't recommend this book to engineers. It seemed rather superficial. The first half of the book dealt with basic electricity, which could have been covered in a single short chapter or thrown into the Appendix. The remainder of the book did not delve into the subject matter of the electricity business in any great detail. I felt unfulfilled after reading the book."
2,"This tool belt is a great value. Regularly priced at over $80, Amazon delivers this belt for under $45. Good weight distribution with the padded back, side pouches, and hammer holster centered in back. It would be nice if the padding extended around the front of the belt. The shoulder straps would probably alleviate any discomfort on the waist/pelvis. However, wearing all that extra gear, especially during the summer can be hot and uncomfortable. Just don't overload the belt with tools you don't absolutely need for a particular job as there are plenty of extra pouches and storage spots for necessary, and sometimes, unnecessary tools. Overall, great product, would recommend to any fellow carpenter."
1,"Sean - take a break! This story needs someone like Terrance Malick. Sean is way in over his head here (and it painfully shows). I could not believe my eyes (and ears). His direction is ""student"" filmmaking at best, and a complete bore at it's worst! Give this one a pass!"
1,"I ordered the SanDisk Cruzer Contour 8 gb from Amazon. What I received is a huge version of this product which requires a USB hub to operate and is far to large to be convenient to use. I later saw a ""Micro"" version of this product in a retail store which is the normal size. I want to return mine."
1,"This guy may be a feted author/chef/whatever but none of his recipes (the ones I have tried anyway) work. I have a couple of his books (cake and cookie) and I intend to chuck them out. I bake quite frequently and get it right 99% of the time including recipes from Martha Stewart, Susan Purdy, Doris Greenspan, Jim Foley...I can go on. Have never bothered writing a review before but everyone, please don't buy his books. And he sounds like a real prima donna."
1,"I was happy with the look and feel of this pan when I received it. However, when I actually tried to use it, I found several issues with the construction.The pop-out bottom, which is advertised as making cleaning and serving easy, kept slipping when I was handling the pan. The lack of a grip makes carrying this pan a bit hard. If you grip the bottom, the pop-out piece may slip and shift the contents and even break the crust.This pan is not at all suitable for pies and tarts with a porous crust and liquidy filling. Half the filling of my tart leaked out of the bottom since the pop-out bottom is not tightly sealed. From now on, I'll only use this pan if I'm making a pie or tart with a solid pie shell and a solid filling."
2,"So, as the title says, do not be expecting this to be a continuation of the first Ong Bak. DO, however, expect this to be a heavy-hitting martial arts movie. Tony Jaa returns to the movie scene but this time implementing more than his traditional use of Muay Thai. He combines a multitude of weapon and unarmed techniques in this great film. To keep this review short, and (hopefully) helpful, if you've enjoyed Jaas films thus far it is unlikely that Ong Bak 2 will disappoint. I won't go into specifics about the story as it is no fun to explain it when you can, and should, watch it for yourself. Personally, I recommend this great movie."
2,"Ramon found the fabulous Pearl of Heaven, but all it earned him was powerful enemies: one human, the other the notorious monster devilfish, The Manta Diablo, which guarded those waters. The story elements, rythmic writing, and the gravity of tone induce comparison to classic myth."
1,This worked really great for about a week and then it broke. Seems cheaply constructed.
2,"Northern Exposure fans have waited for years for this beloved show to be relased. We have stood by while really crappy television shows have been released left and right. Finally, we got what we were waiting for.Well, not quite. As perhaps an obsessive viewer of the show, one of the things I noticed while watching the First Season on DVD was the absence of certain background music. As the two CD soundtracks reflect, ""Northen Exposure"" was a superb venue for diverse, expressive and sometimes downright fun music. Unfortunately, it appears that the creators of the DVD were not able to secure the rights to some of those songs for reproduction on DVD. It is a slight detail, but one that I noticed. Many of the scenes are made by the music. Now, some of those scenes have a different feel to them.Otherwise, I reallly like the features of the DVD and the quality is excellent. The padded jacket (literally) is a strange cover, but appropriately quirky given the show."
1,Tried your product it bent and started to break at heal. Plastic does not make it.
1,"I bought this cooking set and was very unhappy with it. The handles of two of the pots broke quite rapidly. And the non-stick material in the pot deteriorated fast; I guess one can make it last longer by being more careful but still. The red paint on the outisde of the pots also goes off! Really very low quality.If you want a good non-tick pot, go for Calphalon or Tfal."
2,"I dont think Spiderman 1 was so good. The graphics was bad, the sound was blotchy and the swinging was unrealistic. But Spiderman 2 is great fun. You actually get to do tricks with your web and if you swing on a helicopter and dont release your web it will give you a ride. Although Spiderman 2 is a lot easier than the original its much better. I like black cat too. And you can certainly jump higher than the first one along with running faster and doing better and more skilled attacks. Level 3 can get queit irritating. Just when you think you can relax and have a little swing around a timer comes up and you have to go over all the way to another place."
2,This was a fabulous book that makes one really appreciate the simplicity of daily life in America. This is an especially poignant book for mothers who must face life changing decisions. The writing was smooth and the book read well. I would highly recommend this to those who enjoy memoirs. Lee writes about the life of her grandmother and family members who live through some very difficult times. This one will stay on my shelf and I look forward to reading more of Lee's books.
1,"I borrowed the 1999 edition of this book from the library and absolutely loved all 340+ pages of it. I was extremely disappointed to discover that this book is 100 pages shorter. There are fewer sites covered, and the sites that are covered are shown in less detail. I suppose if I had never seen the original book, I might think this book was adequate. Save your money and get a copy of the original edition. And beware of Taschen 25 editions -- I also bought a copy Modernism Rediscovered, only to discover that it is 160 pages shorter than the original. How would anyone know this, when the books have the same titles, authors and publisher as the original editions -- just a lot fewer pages."
1,"I bought this as a fairly inexpensive ebook. It was not worth the price. It reads like an early draft with no proofreading. The book opens with a prologue featuring this run-on sentence, which is missing a verb in the first clause. ""Malka a primitive planet, its habitants very similar to those on earth, where two clans of Barbarian [sic] warriors fight for supremacy; but it is this fight that threatens to eradicate this race of beings."" The hero introduces himself to the heroine as follows: ""I am Niro and I mean you know [sic] harm,"" he said [sic] his voice deep and velvety. The misuse of such basics of 'too' and 'to' and 'know' and 'know, the failure to use the most basic commas, and the complete disregard of the proper verb tense are constant throughout. The author is creative, but the grammar and spelling would cause a grade school child to receive a failing grade."
1,"This stylus has a normal looking button at the top for extending/retracting the various tips. In order to switch between the PDA tip, the pen tip, and the pencil tip you must push this button at the top in 1 of 4 directions as you push it down. This is awkward and sometimes doesn't work correctly. I will sometimes get the pen when I expected the PDA tip, which could cause some serious screen damage.Also, the button sometimes seems to get jammed up and you have to let go and try to push it down again. I ended up removing the pen and the pencil and now only use the pda pen.Not worth the money in my opinion."
1,"This book doesn't cover a lot of practical stuff. As an integrated optics book, the fabrication part and the measurement part are totally missed- what a pity! Buy Hunsperger's ""Integrated optics"" and it is much much cheaper."
1,"This was of no help to me at all. The instructor who appears very masculine talks in a loud, irritating voice and peddles very fast so it's not good for a beginner or intermediate rider. I tried to re-sell this DVD with no takers. Don't waste your money - Just ride your stationary bike for 20-30 minutes at a 90RPM or 25MPH and you'll be OK. Forget this product."
2,"Similar to the old Kidde alarm we had, but this one seems easier to operate. The great thing was it fits on the same frame as the old one, saving me work."
2,"I lthought it is a great story about time travel, but didn't cover the bio-war that was started in the past.Time Traders"
2,"The Legacy of the Phoenix series is a little soap opera-ish, but the characters grip you, and once you start on the first book you will get sucked in and want to read the next two. I recommend the series full heartedly, though I wouldn't start reading the first one unless I was sure I was able to procure the next two, as once you are hooked on the series you will want to blow through all three books back to back. Not five star, but the series is very close to it, and well worth the read."
1,"Everybody is praising this band for being one of the best out there. But my question is why? If the members of this band were not formerly from very successful bands, I can guarantee you they would not get all of the love they are receiving. This CD is boring, choppy, and unoriginal. It is better than a small quantity of its competition, but lacks in interest and creavtity."
2,"Thanks, Universal! After the stellar job on the blu-ray of ""Psycho"", I am sincerely hoping for the same great quality on a film I like even more than that, ""The Birds"". There are a ton of process shots here, and hopefully they will remaster the film properly. Look past the basic 'horror story plot' and to the themes of the picture. Loneliness, family, fear of abandonment. Fellini called this film 'a visual poem'. I will post a review update once I see the blu-ray."
2,"This album is definitely one of his best. Sizzla provides upbeat music with positive vibes in this one. I noticed the Amazon sales rank is lower on this cd than his other albums, but don't be fooled!"
2,love this product. It helps my 3rd and 1st grader will all their math skills. i would recommend this product to everyone.
1,"This pre-911 ""book"" is laughably outdated. Too much has changed since it was written. You'd be much better off finding sources on the web. If you go into the interview with this archaic information, you're going to get killed in the interview."
2,"I really like this printer, and I'm glad I picked it from the competition. If you use the included software, the photos print just like they look on your computer screen and are excellent quality in terms of color and resolution. (If you print from photoshop or some other program, you may have to spend time adjusting the colors of your files to get them to print correctly.) Also, the ink cartridges are ~$14 each and you need refills rather frequently. I've also had a hard time finding these refills-- it seems that these ink cartridges aren't as popular as those for other canon models and are often sold out or hidden at the very bottom of the shelf."
1,This book is the definition of pure dogscat. One star overrates this psychotic piece of pamphlet. I recommend watching the wind blow opposed to reading this nonsense.
1,Very disatisfied and disappointed with the Amazon concept as I never received my product ordered Dec 4th.
2,"This book leaves you selfishly sorry that Rommel's life ended at Hitler's hand before he was able to compile and publish a complete memoire. Liddel-Harts editorials, while at times do help to tie events together, sometimes come across as almost annoying, as if while listening to Rommel speak, someone suddenly interrupts in mid sentence. I also wholeheartedly agree with another reviewer that his comments often come across as almost whining and nit-picking about who deserves credit for what. (Americans or British) While US Grant's and WT Shermans memoires, though fastinating, often drag on with tedious logistical information, Rommel reads more for the layman, packing intensity and excitment and suprising praise for his enemies."
1,"Got the guitar, but the store didnt send the Amp with it, so I am returning it. While I was checking for the amp, saw the guitar and notices how sharp the frets were. The jagged edges on the frets on the guitar neck are sure to cut a childs fingers. I am surprised someone is even allowed to sell that kind of stuff without looking at child safety first. I play the guitar and bass, and I cant picture anyone playing this instrument without cutting their fingers as the move their hands across the neck. Bad worksmanship on this. It did look cute for my son though. I'd hate for his first guitar experience to be painful and discourage him from playing more."
1,"I just listened to the entire CD, and every song sounded exactly like the last one. Enrique may be a cutie, but his music is simply uninspired and uninspiring. And that's a real shame, because he has a nice voice, but he really needs to find some better songwriters."
1,"Well this is a major rip off. I just bought this on on september 17, 2011. When i recieved item the digital copy expired on september 13, 2011."
2,"My 4-month old never tires of playing with this toy! The bright and contrasting colors are great for visual stimulation, and it is just the right size for two small hands to hold. Also, the mirror is one of the largest I've found in toys of this size. Well-made and fun!"
2,"I enjoy these books because they teach how to feel how strange and special life is.Every word is a taste; every phrase is an experience, every page a treasure."
1,"The pajama set that I ordered for my nephew does not fit him. It will probably fit him in about 3 years. The problem was that there were no descriptions of the sizes, and there were only three options for sizes, and they were odd, something like XS, L and XL. It would have been helpful to know what XS and L meant."
2,"Black is an awesome CD! No this aint death metal , but its a great Blues and Rock disc. Love it."
2,"Passed on first try as they promised. I used only this book to prepare for exam. Overall I think it provided good foundation for understanding of PMI processes and their view of project management. However be ready that some terms and definitions in real questions may sound different from how they described in the book. Just don't panic, use what you learned as basis, add some logic and common sense and you'll get through."
2,"Natural history writing is often like porridge. Sometimes it is too hot, and we see nothing but the author's passion for the place he/she is describing. Other times it is too cold, and the writing is merely a dull list of species descriptions and scientific concepts. Weidensaul's book strides that narrow middle ground of being just right. His chapters span the length of the Appalachians, covering topics as diverse as soil science and hawk migrations. However, he never becomes bogged down in dry scientific writing: his love of the Appalachians resonates throughout the book. In a country where most natural history writers turn their eyes west, Weidensaul's book is a much needed overview of an underappreciated mountain range."
2,"My Sinkmaster Disposal bought many years ago requires a 3-inch diameter splash guard which is no longer available, howerer Waste King apparently replaced Sinkmaster but the splash guard is slightly bigger than 3 inches and sits a little more snug in the sink throat. It works really good at preventing splash back when operating the disposal but water or other liquids drain much slower when the disposal is not in use. You cant buy the splash guard separately without the stopper."
1,I only hand wash this unit but water still gets caught in the handle and is the perfect place for black mold to grow. Poor handle design = buying a different brand.
2,"There's been many times in the last few months when I look at W's poll numbers and wonder what his supporters could possibly be thinking; this book crystallizes many of the hunches I've had. Yes, stupidity is part of it, but it's an aggrieved stupidity, and Frank neatly describes the nature of the plenty-plaints.The book is only superficially about Kansas. Frank uses it as an illustration for what has happened in many other parts of the country. Franks thesis is so clear and succinct that it feels as if a couple of the chapters could have been easily omitted without weakening the argument.I've been familiar with Frank's writing since his Baffler days. At his worst, he reads a little like Lewis Lapham's rant-by-the-numbers Notebook pieces. Unlike Lewis, he often hits the target spectacularly (""Alternative to What"", for example).This book is his best work to date."
1,"I really wanted to like this tea because it is full of antioxidants. I was hoping for a fruity flavor, but instead it tastes just like cough syrup. I do not have good memories of cough syrup as a child, so because the flavor reminds me so much of yucky cough medicine, I can not drink it. I tried to drink it anyways, thinking that the benefits of a tea filled with anti-oxidants outweigh the flavor, but I just couldn't do it! Well, that is just my 2 cents. If anyone else has tried this and agrees with me, let me know!"
2,"Great movie--good story line. While you don't see as much of Tommy Lee Jones as you did in the first movie, Will Smith does a bang up job and his partner is unexpectedly good as well. We'll watch this one over and over."
2,"This is a great system replacement if your original is broken. It is also the best price I've seen. However, it does not allow you to use your Game Genie on it. Only Sega 1 and 2 lets you."
2,As an avid book reader I was concerned about abandoning the feel and warmth I get from my hard copy books. Now my Kindle has become my daily friend and traveling companion. I'm just back from a 250 mile round trip from Santa Barbara to LA. I plugged my Kindle into my Ipod input in the car and listened to it all the way down and back. What a great invention.
2,"This is just another great sequel to a great game, the original, the best, C&C. It be just as great as the classic, but it will be more enjoyable to play!!!"
1,"I can not say how well it would have worked, as I received it with a piece of the tip missing and it seemed to be losing another piece next to the lost piece. If a piece could come off before even being used, I would not want to use it for anything that I was going to eat. The factory in China where this was made needs to be told to step up their quality control. I can just imagine using it to cook a red sauce and a piece of the slim tip coming off into the sauce to be digested unknowingly . A fellow had a similar problem with the blue spatula, but I decided to give it try based on a popular cooking mag., I wonder what color they used or if the factory/company changed something for this spatula to have gotten such praise."
1,"The pictures shown are not of the Pharmium model. I think the pics are of the Kickflip model. I have a pair of Pharmium glasses. Great construction, lasts a long time with good lens quality."
2,"We used this book in one of my college Sociology classes and it is by far, the Best textbook I've encountered thus far in my college career! You will be amazed at how much this book will teach you about People, Society and Life! It is easy to follow - Kudos to the author for his outstanding writing style! When you sit down to read a chapter in this book, you're done before you know it because it's all just too interesting to put down! I even found myself reading through the chapters that were not assigned! Even if you're not a sociology student, you will LOVE this book! I want my whole family to read it!"
1,"I use it to power the Panasonic SQT-825, which is a 27W table lamp.I discovered some burning smells lately, so I found this guy.....The plastic cover has already melted...Took the temperature reading from a Fluke IR thermometer, guess what's the reading?????217 F &#65288;103 C&#65289; and, it was stilling raising !!!!!!!!For the sake of your own safety, please please please stopping using it, or DON'T buy it....PS: I also have taken pictures for proof, but i can't upload it because the Amazon only support video...."
2,"History from the beginning is presented in a very interesting way as would have been written if someone was reporting at that time. What I like is that you see what was happening in all parts of the world in a particular time, which makes you realize how advanced some civilizations were compared to others which were concurrent."
2,"Sorry, but I disagree 100% with the previous reviewer. I purchased this book in May 2007 for the New Jersey Praxis Exam in June 2007.The book provides a sample exam with complete explanation for the answers. The book also informs test takers how to prepare for the exam.As a career changer, who has been out of school for 15 years, I used this book to prepare for the exam. I scored in the 95th percentile. I would highly recommend this book.One word of caution, every state has it's own requirements, both in terms of the exam itself and what is a passing grade - thus your own results may vary. In NJ, the actual Praxis exam consists of 120 multiple choice questions which must be completed in 2 hours - very similar to the sample exam provided in this Praxis Study Guide."
1,"This item was listed under the ""Made in USA"" search, so thinking this was true, I ordered it. When I received the item I checked the label on the back of the box and it is made in China!! Very disappointed!!!!!!!!!"
1,DVD was defective--last half the audio was totally out of sync. Standing Ovation took forever to acknowledge my complaint. After 4 or 5 e-mails they finally responded. A refund or a new dvd is being processed. I'm not sure which. Communication is not the best.
1,"I have a newer model string trimmer - one without the recall. Today was the 3rd time I used it. It broke. The motor runs, but the spool & line does not. I, like others, bought B&D because it WAS a name I respected. After finding the closest repair center is a 100 miles away, I am going to spend half the cost of the trimmer to send it for repairs. (Warranty doesn't cover shipping.) If you go to the B&D website you can see that B&D makes DeWalt and Stanley. If they have gone to making disposable equipment, you may want to avoid their other products."
1,"An O.K book for starters and who want to get to know a bit about N/W design. But, it's too non-technical to be of any use to designers. Definitely, not CCIE level. Not worth buying if you can get same info from cisco web-site"
1,I9900 IS JUNK JUST LKIE EVERYONE ELSE I HAVE SPENT MORE TIME TRYING TO GET IT TO WORK PROPERLY AND NOW IT WILL NOT TURN ON. DON'T BY THIS.
1,"Bait & switch! I purchased 2 of these, thinking that they were the Cyclops 10MCP shown in the picture and described in the specs. What came were two cheapo units that are similar to the Scout model. The batteries were two 6V 5Ah wired in series, and the construction was cheap plastic all around.Northern agreed to refund my money for the return, but not shipping. For the +$40 total shipping I would've had to drop (both ways), it was more feasible to just keep these as beater units.The light pictured in this sale is a good one ... but it's not what you get when you order from Northern."
2,"This is an incredible little device, and a must have if you do exposure shots. Just remember to go into the menu to change the settings or it won't work."
2,My wife and I really enjoyed this movie and was really impressed by how good the special effects were for a low budget film. The acting was good too and of course the story is outstanding.
1,"Michael Moore blames ""capitalism"" for the economic problems in this country. He is mistaken; it is ""corporate socialism"" that is at fault.When the judge (in the documentary) was sentencing juveniles into a privatized detention complex, we viewers are led to believe that this is an example of capitalism run amok. Wrong! Because this involved government money being funneled into a private company, it's really corporate socialism.In contrast, within a ""free enterprise"" system, private companies are allowed to succeed or fail on their own merits -- without government subsidies. Michael Moore needs to do his homework."
2,"This is the crown jewel of Rajah products for me. Always good, not too spicy, classic restaurant taste, a winner every time!"
2,"This was a lovely story that upheld old-fashioned values.Tyler and Hailey upheld certain standards and I found that refreshing. I do not feel that Tyler ""sexually harrassed"" Hailey.This story is romantic ""FICTION"" at its best. Enjoy!"
1,"What a disappointment!!! We bought this for my 4 year old son for a Christmas present. He asked Santa for it several times and was so excited that it was a ""John Deere"" themed bike as he loves his grandpa's John Deere tractor. Thank God we tried to put it together before the holiday or else we would have had one very sad little boy on our hands on Christmas morning. The forks the hold the front tire onto the bike do not align at all, making it IMPOSSIBLE to get the front tire onto the bike. Aside from this major manufacturer defect, there also are no assembly instructions included with the bicycle. All in all, this product is very cheaply made. Now, not only do we have to buy our son a new bike someplace else, but we have to explain to him why Santa couldn't deliver the ""John Deere"" bike that he asked him for. Thanks Learning Curve."
1,"Prior to purchasing the Tae-Bo beginners video, I spent a lot of time reading the feedback online. After seeing the mixed reviews that are out there, I decided to try the videos for myself before passing judgement. I cannot believe this workout video has received the national attention that it has! I admire Billy Blanks strong marketing/PR strategy efforts but feel that this video falls very short of the hype. The video production quality itself is very poor- Surprising considering the $35 price tag and the workout itself is anything but the motivating, fun workout it is advertised to be. I am in the process of taking Billy up on his money back guarantee to invest in a better workout video. I would recommend to anyone considering this video to either rent it or borrow it from a friend before making the purchase and having to return it as I do."
1,"The cake didn't have the shape of a** ball it was just an ordinary round cake, I couldn't even see the lines of the pan."
1,The bra is pretty but I just cant wear underwires. They won't take product back as it is a undergarment...wish I would have known that before I spent money on it!
2,The Malibu Power Pack with Timer and Ground Shield was just as represented. I installed them and they work perfectly. I would recommend Amazon.com to anyone.
1,I want to like Cocteau Twins but they just come short of what the band Trance to the Sun does. TTTS is everything Cocteau Twins wishes they were.
1,"I enjoyed the music but the story completely misrepresented the Christian faith and at times made fun of it. The one person who realized that their singing should have been for the glory of God was portrayed as up-tight and hard nosed. She was converted in the end and joined the others for the win. The teenage daughter was encouraged to not be a ""Church girl"" and disobey her mom and do what she felt like. The movie sent a very poor message. Even if your not a Christian you can at least respect the choices of those who are."
2,This book was recommended to me by my dog trainer. It was very helpful in explianing my dog's silent ( body) language. It is written in a nonscientific form and was easy to read and reference. I would suggest this book for anyone that has a dog or is going to get one.
1,"This book is full of errors, and is the worst computerbook I ever bought! I don't know what contents insidethe book to trust.I wish I have saw the similar comments given by othersand bought the other books, such as that entitled as""SCWCD Exam Stdudy kit""."
1,"This was just like any other cheap novel. I'm glad I got it at Goodwill because I would have been upset if I had spent more than a couple of quarters on it.The story line was weak and disjointed. The story started off interestingly enough, but it quickly plunged into mediocrity. And if you're a Roman Catholic, the ""history"" of the saints will just rub you the wrong way.I don't want to waste any more time writing about how bland and boring this book was. I HAD to finish it to see if it would redeem itself, but it didn't."
1,This book was very lame and overly idealized. The one benefit is that it is short and does give some information on Six Sigma/Lean methodologies.
1,"After I read the reviews, I boought it anyhow. Yes, it does not sit flat enouogh to read without picking it up.At least I can pick it up to look at and read. The display is clear and bright enough to read."
1,We couldn't watch it because of the filthy language. Totally inappropriate for familyviewing. Why can't Hollywood get it right?
2,I hope that Jade does not get Jeremy. She treats him like dirt. I hope Jessica and Jeremy get back together. I can't wait until Never Let Go comes out.
2,wow I wish I could find this juicer again-Juice Master Deluxe Juice Extractor model # Jm2500 I had 3 juicers- this one was my favoite I miss it- so easy to use and clean! Let me know where i can find one !!
2,Love it - I put all my old 33 1/3's on CD but must have given the Warm and Willing record away so this was great to find the two on one.Thanks.
1,"I bought this humidifier because Hamilton Beach advertises that the tank and tray are dishwasher safe and I assumed this meant that I could enjoy the convenience of cleaning the tank in the dishwasher. Well, they may be dishwasher safe, but the tank is TOO BIG to fit in a standard dishwasher. This seems like misleading advertising at the least!"
2,I've bought this product for awhile now and I love the scent. I would recommend it to anyone who like's a clean and fresh smell.
2,"This heating pad is a great size for application to large areas of the body (lower back, thigh, wrap around an arm/elbow, etc). The heat cycle keeps it from becoming uncomfortably warm and the lack of automatic shut off is a hard-to-find feature. The cover comes off easily, launders well, and isn't scratchy (though I usually have an additional layer of pillowcase or light towel between my skin and the heating pad for additional comfort)."
1,"I got these at my local Petco store, figured I could use them when I went home for spring break. My mistake, these things are pieces of junk. I placed one in my bettas tank and it sunk watched and it did not appear to release any food. Plus it has plugged up two filter cartridges in just a matter of days. I do not recommend these."
2,This is probably the best one of the series.It's a very gory and realistic movie in terms of visuals. It will make your stomach turn and your hand will cover your face in shock and disgust.
2,"this is a serious deal. From an audio perspective, this speaker system does the job with my MacBook. Yes, there is no shielding, and RF noise can and does bleed through, but again, look at the price, and put this purchase into perspective. Frankly, this sounds almost as good as my Logitech Z-2300 system that I use in the classroom."
1,"This software is excellent for the PC platform. It is very good for the N64 platform. For the Color Gameboy platform, one should not even bother purchasing it. I thought I'd get somewhat similar graphics to Tarzan; this game has graphics similar to mid-80s games - it is a major disappointment. If I could return it, I'd do so in a second. This game has to be one of the worst-conceived games for the gameboy platform. If you want to buy NFL Blitz 2000 - buy it for the PC, don't bother to buy it for the gameboy"
1,Makes great popcorn until it breaks and it will break. I've gone through 2 of these in a very short time. The 1st one broke where the electrical connections make contact. I thought maybe I got a lemon so I'll give the machine a second chance. The second one broke even quicker than the first. This one broke at the release buttons used to connect and disconnect the stirrer/heating portion of the machine from the base.I will not work because this also holds the electrical connections together. These poppers are junk. Enough is enough. I gave up and bought a simpler machine that does work great.The West Bend Stir Crazy (Costs around $30.00).Try it I think you will agree. Hope this helps
1,I read some reviews that it was good to make the hair grow but it my hair fall out alot!!!!
1,"Game only makes it half way before it says to clean the disk.I've tried cleaning it multiple times, but nothing works."
1,"Only good part was fast shipping. There was already rap music on the memory so I assume it was someone else's return. Took over an hour with sandisk representative (thanks Skype) to figure out how to download. Battery lasts very short time, cheesy build, sound is 7/10th and bottom keeps falling off."
1,"The 5-star reviews are from record label interns desperate to hype up this record, but I'll give you the truth: this record is very dated. Prince has always been a weird one. He's been completely dethroned by a slew of better, more talented artists: Britney, Kylie, Beyonce, Justin, and Jessica. The list goes on. I'd stay away from this turkey; it isn't any good."
2,"B5 is a great group for the youth and elder. All the songs on the album are good. Every single one one them has talent. They all sing and one rap. Dustin, Kelly, Patrick, Carnell and Bryan make up the group of B5. There song you got me is a hit. It makes you wanna jam for real. And their other hit All I do is a song that all of us ladies would like. Its so romantic. So support them youngsters and buy there cd yall!"
2,The Cliffhanger scene with the Raccoon was alone worth it to watch the film. Jim Carrey does an excellent job as the eccentric pet detective.All the scenes are hilarious and you really do see the brilliance in this film!
2,This is my all time favorite children's book. Beautiful illustrations. Makes a great gift for a new mother.
2,"So far I have only seen this movie 12 times in the pass two weeks. I may be 56 years old but I love a great horrorstory. My favorite part be the ending. I'm still not quite sure about the ending, I was very surprised at the ending, I had no ideal. If you like being being kept of the edge and you also like a love story, this is it. I brought the bookand dvd."
2,"No Nudity (except the giant naked zombie mother at the end)Gore off the scale. Most looks fake but some is quite brutal.The movie is silly, I thought well acted, and like I mentioned you should watch it just for the copious gory violence. There is now reason to discribe it, its just relentless butchering of bloody zombies.We see early work of the talented directing of Peter Jackson.Recommend (but like I said no T,A, or P)"
1,I once attempted to read this book. I got about fifty pages into the book before the talking dolphin got me so confused that I could not finish it.
2,this is a good season and leads up to the cell gamessome good fights in this set that make it really coolthis is a must have
2,"I enjoyed the film. The story is nothing to write home about but it's clever enough. The cast is what makes it. Many folks here pan Andie MacDowell and I admit that I got the film inspite of her. But she was surprising good. I thought she and Depardieu had great chemistry and their odd-coupling was just absurd enough to work.I loved her apartment and that wonderful greenhouse! The other shots of New York are fun to see, particularly their hike across Central Park.All in all I thought the film held together well and it makes an entertaining two hours. (hated D's hair style though; he looked like Javier Bardem in No Country for old Men!)"
2,"Written for survivors of crime, rape, family dysfunction, and everything else, this usefull book centers itself on Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome. The thing is, most who have PTSD aren't even aware of it. Guilt, depression, suicide, and ""acting out"" are some of the symptoms. God, practically the entire world falls into this category. This is a very valuable book for everyone, regardless of whether or not you ""think"" you have it. Would also recommend two other great books on the subject, though they are fiction: ""Good Grief"" and ""The Bark of the Dogwood."" Both are excellent and great character studies."
2,"If you are looking for something different to give your childs teacher, try this book. Have your child dedicate the book to her teacher and in turn, the whole class gets to enjoy the book. It's something different that our teachers appreciated. Fun for all."
1,I rec'd a DVD that did not work. It will not play so that is why I rated this item so low.
1,"You know why I bought this game? You got it, I did because I wanted to use cards like injection fairy lily (lod-100), yata-garasu (lod-000), etc., those very cool cards of the real game, in the gameboy advance. Unfortunately, rules are now new and very confusing (I don't understand why Konami did this). In this sense the previous game, the eternal duelist, is by far superior. Another good point of this latter game (world wide edition) is that kids that can not read english (yet) from different countries can use it! It is true that Sacred Cards have better and animated grafics but..."
1,"This is probably the most worthless album REM ever put out. The songs are badly written, mostly constructed around punk and grunge cliches. Most of the songs have no real melody, and the ones that do have melodies sound exactly like previous REM songs. REM, in spite of their protests to the contrary, were never a punk band, and this album proves it. This was the beginning of a long downturn for REM from which they have not yet recovered; in this reviewer's opinion, they should have broken up after ""Automatic For The People."""
1,"I can honestly this that never before have I ever read a book that made me wish to toss it out the window. The premise of the book sounded interesting and original; however, at three chapters in, I had to put it down. I forced myself to finish it, hoping for something worthy to make this purchase worthwhile. I finished this book and was disgusted. I can honestly say that if this is an example of her work, then I will assuredly never read anything associated with her name again."
2,"I got this to store a common key for our sound booth at church. Easy to set the combination and install. No wall anchors are provided, probably because they want you to screw it into a stud. Good, simple solution for a very reasonable price."
2,"Abby Bardi explores the world of a young fundamentalist and the lives she touches, while raising crucial issues of identity for both the characters and the reader. This book was a joy to read and the first novel I've read in one sitting in quite a while. I was sorry when it was over, and can't wait for Bardi's next one."
1,"These bags are just like Ziploc bags. In fact, I see no difference. Even the press to seal seam at the top is just like a Ziploc and doesn't appear to be more heavy-duty. Thickness of bag the same too, as far as I can tell. Since I'm not diving with it, I just needed to keep sand/moisture off of items, I could have used a Ziploc and had the same amount of protection. If you truly need a waterproof bag, save your money and buy a thick bag with a heavy-duty closure."
1,"My daughter who is 10 months old loved this toy in the store. When we took it out of the package the volume decreased tremendously. We called the company and they said it was for safety reasons. I understand that, but you can't hear anything. It would be a good toy to teach numbers, etc. but you can't hear it. She doesn't play with it much at all. She prefers her noisier toys. I would like to know how the one customer's husband made the toy loud again. This toy was a waste of money"
2,"Ruth Beechick is a comforting voice of confidence to new homeschoolers and math-phobics. She made me feel equipped and prepared to introduce math skills to my children. This book is worth every penny and more for the fun ideas, using basic household items, and the wise counsel. You would have to dig through volumes to get this kind of quality information, otherwise."
1,"WARNING: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS RECOMMENDED BATTERY FOR THE PANASONIC DMC-ZS1 DIGITAL CAMERA! REGARDLESS OF WHAT AMAZON.COM TELLS YOU, IT IS NOT THE CORRECT SIZED BATTERY FOR THIS CAMERA. I HAD A HECK OF A TIME GETTING A REFUND FOR THE BATTERY AND DIDN'T GET REIMBURSED FOR THE S&H (EVEN THOUGH I PAID MORE TO HAVE IT SHIPPED RIGHT AWAY AND IT COST MORE THAN THE ACTUAL BATTERY)!"
1,"I have never before submitted a review on amazon but feel compelled to do so in this instance. This book is terrible. The characters, scenarios, and dialogues are almost without exception trite and formulaic to the point of inducing nausea."
1,"The information in this book tends to be very simple and basic. I suppose it might be helpful for those new to Palm handhelds, but anyone who has ever used one before won't learn much. That's not necessarily a criticism of the book, but the target audience is definitely the Palm novice. What's more of a ""value-for-the money"" problem, though, is that the Getting Started guide included as a PDF file on the CD that comes with your Zire has most of the information in this book. If you're a Zire owner, why pay for something that you already have? If you need more than the documentation that comes with your handheld, look for a book that is more advanced - and thus more useful - than this one!"
1,"This book was AWFUL. The worst part is that I hung in there until the very end, for some reason thinking that it would pull together into a good story. But it was a bad joke, and poorly written at that. The author appears to have some uncanny talent for writing about incredible things by sucking the life out of them until they are not emotionally moving in the least. The characters were poorly developed and unlikable. The references to mIRC and ""haXXors"" were just plain STUPID. I could perhaps see the story appealing to a preteen, but there's too much inappropriate X-rated trash in this book for that to be a good thing."
2,"I absolutely LOVED this movie!! I truly fell in love with Tom Sullivan, as played by Marc Singer. The man was fearless and willing to try anything, and I don't believe he regarded his blindness as a handicap. A fun and joyous romp. I just wish they'd release it on DVD!"
1,"Need for Speed Most Wanted is my favorite racing game of all time...the console version. It's amazing graphics and very addictive game. Unfortunately, PSP edition is nothing like it. It's easy at first 12 blacklist and it's get very repetitive. It's almost impossible to beat. Ths Cops chase you every single race. It's very hard to play. DO NOT get this game. Get the console version. It's the best game ever!!!"
1,"I love this movie and was eagerly antcapting buying this so when I saw a large department store had it on sale at a good price i bought it. I got home only to discover the disc very scratched and the movie not playable without skips every few seconds. I took it back and tried to get another one and opened it in front of the clerk only to find another one in the same condtion. Fox please make your discs better, we deserve atleast a disc without scratches when we buy a movie. I have had problems with many fox discs being this way French Conneection, CAstaway, Mash Five star collection and die hard trilogy box set. People dont let fox take advanatge of you when you get a scratched disc return it and show fox that it will cost them in the long run..."
1,"I was really interested in hearing more from Alan Watts and his view on life. But once i got the CD's I found out that Alan Watts was only in for brief segments, and that the CD was actually narrated by another gentlemen. I've been searching for a long time for pieces of Alan Watts segments that he has in his life and I thought that ""the way of zen"" was an audio collection of his work, however, it only offers very small recordings here and there. I really do wish that there are CD's with his teachings and views on life where i can hear him speak, not someone narrating his voice and words."
1,"I've used Gold Toe Fluffies for many years. Over time the quality has declined. Either they come or they quickly become ""non-fluffy."" Quality decline is apparent as stray yarns arise from the top of the sock before the first wearing or washing."
2,"Great software. My daughter loves every feature about it. I am glad I was able to find Lilo and Stitch characters. In addition, it has Disney's latest characters for Treasure Planet. A must have for all Disney fans!!!!"
1,"The product is well made and goes together easily. Unfortunately, if you have a cast that goes up almost to the knee, all the weight of your body will press against the cast and into your leg below the knee. This makes the Knee Walker extremely uncomfortable after a few minutes. Try this:1. Put a folding chair with a padded seat in front of you.2. Bend your ""bad"" leg so the cast is horizontal.3. Place all your weight on the cast with the chair underneath.If this doesn't cause any discomfort, the knee walker will probably work OK for you. Thick carpet, going backwards and tight spaces (constantly lifting it to change directions) are annoying, but if it weren't for the extreme pressure just below my knee, I could live with it."
2,This is a great vent shade. It is very simple to install. I like the surface prep that comes in the package. I strongly suggest using the prep pads for a good fit.
2,"During my pregnancy, I suffered from PUPPP. This was the best of a bunch of stuff I tried neutragena itch relief something, calamine lotion. Steroids were not recommended during pregnancy. Benedryl knocked me out but still did not take the itch away completely. Sarna was cooling. Relief was temporary. I carried it everywhere and applied liberally as often as needed!"
2,"I was impressed and enthralled with this work. I will admit that, but you have to keep it in perspective. This is not fact and it in no way compares to the Bible. It is an enjoyable read and will draw you into the story, but for no reason should it be substituted for a genuine study of the Biblical book of Revelation. If the book spurs you on to greater invesitgation thats great. I am looking foward to the seventh book which is now available, but if you are looking for a gift for some unsaved friend that will ""lead them to Christ"" keep looking. This book seems to be written for Believers."
2,"Very imprtant book which everyone should read. I think government should be smaller but this book gives case studies which clearly show why it is important for government to do some things. Very detailed so should not be considered ""light"" reading."
2,"This is a great example of toms range--he makes it clear in this release that he is not just about one style such as drum and bass-- here he clearly explores heavy funk and jazz elements--i feel his early albums have a more jazzy feel that the album which he iscredited for being a ""jazz fusion thig which wpould be the ""rotted one note"" album-- this album is approaching electronic music not as a categorial thing but as an extension of a musical experience and i feel tom is able to make one of the most consistent artistic statements out there in relation to versatile styles."
2,"As a technical consultant, I have to use a laptop 40-50 hours a week. The Dell Latitude keyboard I use is killer on my wrists.This accessory is superb. Very comfortable. I now longer have to work from home and use my desktop ergonomic keyboard when my wrists hurt too much."
2,"I bought this harness from a local sporting goods shop, and have been climbing with it for awhile. It does eventually wear down (as all gear tends to do with heavy use), but for the price, I would highly recommend this harness for any climber. I used it while I was still learning, then continued to use it as I honed my skills (both activities are rough on gear due to a lack of a climbing style), and continued using it to teach, lead and even a first assent (Cactus is Not Your Friend, Joshua Tree National Park). I am now due to purchase a new harness, and I might even re-buy this one, as it treated me well."
2,"This book is the best. I have reread it about 20 times and it gets better everytime I read it. Four masters of this genre in romance writing have created the best book ever. While the stories are not as long as the typical single romance novel, each story gets and keeps you involved to the very end. The erotica part of the stories are well written and the romance part of the stories are exciting as well. I bought this book originally because I love anything written by Bertrice Small. I have discovered three other great romance novelists in Robin Schone, Thea Devine and Susan Johnson by reading this book. I have read romance novels for over 25 years and this book really is excellent. It is the ""mild and gentler"" type of erotica (the kind that leaves you breathless but not embarrassed should anyone see the book you are reading)."
1,"I bought this cover for my 1st generation Kindle, but it is sized for the 3rd generation model. Very aggravating!!"
1,To whom it may concern. I purchased a set of DeWalt Nibblers DW896 2100 spm 16-gauge for my husband. He used them one time cut very little and they acted as if they were dull. He was cutting 29- gauge barn siding. Bought them through Amazon.com and called them and can not return because it is a couple days past their 30-day return policy. what should i do?
1,Do not buy this stroller! I use it once a week and it broke before my son is just over 8 months old. It won't close. The wheels are hard to manage. AND most importantly the harness does not securely attach to the back of the stroller. It's a flimsy piece a plastic the easily slides out.
2,"I hate rap, but you gotta love Eminem. He's a lough-a-minute man...and please, have a little (black) humor!"
2,"We fans are treated to a wonderful first season. Not to fear, the show along with FOX's 24 is coming back in 2005. We'll learn more in the second season about who Tru Davies is and why she has this special gift to give a second chance to those who died. Its a powerful piece of mythology in that all of us wish we could rewind the hands of time and get to see loved ones and friends one more time. I give it 4 instead of 5 stars simply that this being the first season, not all of the story threads have been worked out. Hopefully that will all change next year."
1,I purchased this feeder due to the 2 positive reviews. I just opened the package and to my great disappointment I see the bottom does not come apart for cleaning! Those of us who love and feed hummingbirds know that we have to be meticulously clean with their feeders. I am not sure if I will even use this one as I see no way to reach into all the nooks and crannies.I was into walmart the other day and purchased several perky pet feeders for$3.88. They have turned out to be my absolute favorite. Every part of that little feeder comes apart for thorough cleaning. At that price you could purchase new ones every season!
1,"I've heard better jazz from Montevani and Gordon Jenkins. In fact, this isn't jazz at all. It's commercial, uninteresting pap, good at best for creating pleasant background noise during a cocktail party. I see that someone wants more than $50 for the album. I tossed my copy."
1,"I rushed to the video store yesterday to rent this as soon as it came out; I'd been really looking forward to seeing it, but decided to rent it first before buying it. I've been burned in the past. But how bad could it be? It's by Tim Burton, the guy who brought us ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" and the original Batman movie.I'm very glad I did.This movie comes nowhere near the genius of Nightmare; it's a tepid and insipid story that lacks energy, set to a totally forgettable score by Danny Elfman (another huge disappointment of this movie).The only memorable character in this piece is the Corpse Bride herself. The rest of the characters, especially Victor (voiced by Johnny Depp) are yawn-inspiring.Where's Jack Skellington when you need him?"
1,I am so sick of these things being released without CDMA/EVDO or some cell service. From Nokia of ALL COMPANIES!Get with the times and offer an internet device that doesn't require me to be in 50 feet of a damn router.
1,"I purchased this because it was so highly rated online, even though I was wary of this style carrier. After several attempts of use, neither I nor my 8 week old felt very secure with it. The concept made sense, and the material is nice, but I never felt comfortable with her in it,and neither did she."
1,"The little clip on the side broke off the first day I had it. No pressure was applied, it just fell off. The tip of this item is not solid and will wear or could be easily torn. Worth a dollar in my opinion, nothing more."
2,The goggles are terrific. They really keep the sun and glare away and provide very clear views underwater. They are a little hard to adjust though.
1,"Usually I am not the sort of person who complains about a poor choice I made. This Video was so bad I feel that I want to suggest to anyone else considering it not to do so. There is almost nothing of any value about raising puppies in this video. Uncle Matty seems more interested in becoming the Car Talk brothers of dogs, than in providing solid information to those of us who are looking for reasonable assistance in bringing a puppy into their lives. We have seen about 4 or five videos or DVDs on puppies and the best was an older Video entitled ""Good Puppy"" by Jeanne Carlson, available on this site"
1,"First, any additional sleaze scenes on the DVD? Nope.So, what we got here is one scene with a previously-whipped back of a pretty blonde being admired by the sadistic guard, and then a full back nude scene of the blonde as she tries to escape. Two brief bottom shots, that's it. They're pretty good though, very realistic whip damage, one of the best ever.There's some other minor nudity (the undressing scene at the start of course), and I might give it one more star if it wasn't for the absolutely gutless cop out of showing zero actual whipping scenes in a movie titled like this. Shameful.I suppose it has to be in the collection for the cell scene mentioned above."
1,"The readers were DECEIVED!!! This book sucked. Apparently, Small and Woodiwiss have the same agenda- bore their readers to death. What happened to the great writing of the past?"
2,"The first time I saw the Safer Bather on the site, I didn't consider registering for any other bathing product. I had no desire to place my newborn in a hard plastic tub, and his first bath was a great experience with the Safer Bather-- he was well supported and comfortable. Easy maintenance-- just wring out and hang to dry. On one occasion, the baby had a bm during his bath and while it would have been nice for the mess to rinse off a little more easily, I rinsed it off as best I could then tossed it in the washing machine. This is a great product for baby's bathtime."
1,"Im here sitting at my comp. and im looking for artists ""related"" to At The Drive In (a very respectable band mind you) and up pops My Morning Jacket. Before i go any further hear this THEY ARE NOTHING LIKE AT THE DRIVE IN! If you people would like to hear music ""related"" to At The Drive In why don't you check out Snapcase. but if you rather keep listening MMJ be my guest, but please don't dirty the name of A.t.d.i. by comparing them to crap."
1,The first CD set I received had a blank 2nd disc. I sent it back for replacement and the 2nd disc on the replacement is also blank. Obviously a bad batch. Amazon isn't going to replace this one for me but will issue a credit.
2,"I'll admit, I've been a big Britney fan from the very beginning but I think from an objective standpoint, this is her most competent album to date. Contrary to some of the recent press coverage, the album is not that sexual in its lyrical content. There are a few lines here and there but I've heard far worse on the radio.Musically, the tracks have some of the catchiest hooks I've heard in a while. And I think she successfully incorporated other musical genres from trance, to hip-hop, to dancehall. I think this album will have great staying power based on the strength of potential singles like ""(I've Got That) Boom Boom"", ""The Hook up"", and ""Breathe on Me"". The song ""Everytime"" is a very simple, poignant reflection on lost love that comes across beautifully. All in all, I think even non-Britney fans would enjoy this album and I highly recommend it.(...)If you're a Britney fan, you'll love it. If you're not, give it a try, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."
1,This battery worked for a little while but then would get a battery error every time I turned it on. My camera was the W series.
1,"Fortunately, this crap died a month before warranty expired (I think it was 2 years). Service man who came to fix this when only my mom was at home, tried to blame me for a misuse. His argument was that I was not supposed to install firmware upgrade that was available at Samsung's own homepage. My mom called me at work and I had to explain all the process that I took to upgrade the firmware. After about 10 minutes, the service guy replaced some kind of board for free.After another year, now 4/5th of the screen shows very dark tint. It goes away after the TV warms up (takes about 10 minutes), but it bothers me in the morning when I just want to check news while having breakfast. Now it's after warranty, I'm not gonna try to fix this. I'd rather just put this in my garage and buy Sony, LG, Visio, or whatever non-Samsung brand."
2,This was a very charming book. I have read all of her books and think she is such a great author. Max and Lola are fun characters. My favorite part of the book was Lola's family reunion. I think the book would have been funnier if she had spent more time with the insane family members... If you love Rachel Gibson you will love this book.
2,"I bought this book just yesterday and have already read the whole thing. Let me be clear, I have never built a computer. The thought occured to me about a week ago, when I got fed up with my old one. So I went to a local bookstore and picked up a few books and looked through them. Then all of a sudden the title ""Building the Perfect PC"" jumped out at me. I picked it up and it had color photos showing what was being done. It is a wonderful book and I just went out and bought a case today using their advice and will begin building soon!!"
1,"Was totally surprised that this film got any good press whatsoever! The acting is not as good as that you'd see in a high school play--lustreless, wooden--the scene is nothing like a real disco--it's clean, roomy and not thick with smoke. Discos--even the best, at there best, were crowded, smokey, and filled with debauchery, music so loud you had to scream to be heard, and drugs everywhere. This is inaccurate as well as boring."
2,I am extremely pleased with the gel petals. They are a fantastic price. I was able to get 5 sets for the same amount of money that I have been paying for 1 set.
2,This was a great book that made me laugh out loud in certain parts.It really took a stab at the current reality TV craze that's racing through the country right now.Great book!
1,"Interesting enough but a definite British focus. And a caveat: the entry on ""safety pin"" includes a gigantic, eye-popping photo of Elizabeth Hurley in her infamous Versace safety pin dress. While it definitely shows a creative use for safety pins, the picture isn't particularly appropriate to include in this kind of book. So if you're thinking about buying for a kid, reconsider."
1,Train set construction less than expected for price. Had difficulties getting the trains to lineup on track. Wouldn't have bought if known the construction was not great.
1,These types of books should be removed from the inventory so they are not ordered in error assuming that it would be a current year publication.
2,"I think i have read 10 or 12 of his books since January 1, 2013. Each and everyone holds your attention and is very entertaining. A must read for western fans"
2,I bought microsoft wireless optical mouse 3000-slate in less than $20. It works perfect..cursor movement is smooth. The design is simple. It is lightweight and wireless range is good.It senses the signal even from 6 ft far away from the laptop. I was just testing because I read few comments that mouse does not work properly if you are a bit away from the pc. Anyway it works good for me and I am happy to bought this mouse.-Updating the review very long time.This mouse didn't last long. It died after 6 months.Worked good till it lasted. I would be apprehensive to buy hardware product from microsoft.
2,"This magnificent 3-CD set released by Rhino touts itself as 'the mother of all box sets,' and it's difficult to argue the point. In chronological order and beginning with the pristine recordings of such blues luminaries as BB King, Howlin' Wolf, Joe Hill Louis, Rufus Thomas, and Little Junior Parker, this box set takes the listener on a breathless journey through the historical, hit-making years of the mid-through-late 1950's, featuring the best of Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison, Charlie Rich, and lesser-known hilbilly cats. The importance and influence of this music is almost indescribable, and this economical/educational box set summarizes the period better than any."
2,"This printer is a great companion to my S30 camera ... fast, quite, and vivid colors. I do not have to power up my laptop for printing ... just insert compactflash card or connect the camera to the printer. Be sure to use Canon papers to archive the similar quality as photos through Ofoto.com"
1,"This is my first attempt at reading PK Dick. This book tried hard to be _something_... and I tried hard to find out _what_... but the experience left me with a headache and a vague nausea. I'm going to try another of his books, but this one left me ill."
1,"Oddly un-entertaining and over-directed try at the O.K.Corral.Amasing that fine director John Sturges, who made such good movies as ""The great escape"" and ""Bad day at Black Rock"", didn't make this one better! Even the final shoot-out is boring and disappointing as is the title-song by Frankie Laine. Grab ""My Darling Clementine"" or ""Tombstone"" instead!"
1,GOOD GOD! This is butchery! The added scenes were terrible! The music was absolutley asstacular! Why? Whyyyyyy? The only reason that I gave this movie a two was because it still contains some of the classic film. I'm suprised that the genius who thought up the idea to add those horrible scenes didn't just ditch the whole movie and just remake it starring that damn preacher.
2,"Lucki sta(Lucky Star) is a high school ladies stories.There are no important things in the stories.But it is well presented Japanese high school days.People call a person without Mr. and Ms.Instead of Mr. or Ms., chan or san are used after the name.It is explained in the notes in the package.In japanese, speaking is a little slow.But English version is a little fast.That is the main difference in Japanese version and English version.Best Regards."
2,"OMG OMG OMG Actually that about sums up what I think of this DVD. This man and his band are, well there aren't enough adjectives to describe how wonderfully amazing there truly are. From the first album, Talking Book, to this latest, Stay, I didn't think it could get any better. I love watching this DVD. It's one thing to listen to the CD but it's an unbelievable experience watching Mick sing. It seems so effortless and he truly enjoys what he does, it's so obvious. That voice, that sound that comes out of him is a Godsend. I can't even imagine what it must feel like to be able to sing like that, to entertain like that. He has to be the luckiest man alive. If you like Simply Red you'll love this DVD. Get it now while you still can before Simply Red are no more. I'm actually looking forward to what he does on his own. I'm sure he will continue to mesmerize us for years to come. ALL HAIL MICK HUCKNALL AND SIMPLY RED!"
2,The pictures are awesome. The clarity and color are very nice.A great book for anyone interested in gem stones.
2,"This is one of the most imaginative collections of erotica that I have read. The stories are fantasies or fairy tales, and they are wonderful. The author devises weird or unusual plots and premises that are all the more sensual and sexy for being out of the ordinary (and I don't mean ""perverse,"" the way that word used to be used). Highly recommended for its originality, beauty, and erotic charge."
2,Although I thought this was going to be a CD it turned out to be a DVD. It was very enjoyable and it came quickly in the mail and was in perfect A-1 condition. Thank you
2,A great resource to find and learn your architectural specific definitions. Don't just search the web and use the first definition your search engine provides. Use this and find the right answer.
2,"The Confessions of a thug reveals the inner-world of the drug underworld, a world in which a persons life can be snuffed out in the blink of an eye. Totally moving."
2,It's a pump and it works. There's a little cavity at one end where you hide the needle. I used it for grass volleyball. My only complaint is that one of my friends snaked it.
2,"Why would they promote the import version of this CD on the same page as the MP3 download, only to eliminate four of the songs on the CD? Almost every song is great, but again, my favorite track, the live version of ""You Keep On Moving"" is not available as a download."
2,"The Russo family may be living in the Lowcountry, but they're as Italian as their Sicilian roots. So when 32-year-old Grace moves in with her agnostic Irish boyfriend, fireworks start to fly. What kind of miracle would it take to change their minds?Frank serves up something new with this soul-searching tale of transplanted Yankees, but she's as witty and engaging as ever. A great read, as always - and just perfect for a day at the beach."
1,"What a total piece of junk! Don't waste your time with this camera. We got one as a Christmas present, it quickly went in the trash. It turns on and takes pictures fine. When you turn it off, it doesn't turn back on. You have to remove the batteries and reinstall them to get it to turn on again. If you just leave it in the drawer, it drains the batteries so you also have to replace them the next time you want to use it. Never got around to actually downloading the pictures, we just threw it away."
2,This is probably the best moisturizing balm I've ever used. I use it before I put on lipstick to avoid lip lines.
1,"This did not work for my super nintendo. I do not recommend this for anyone. It only kind of worked, it provided just enough power for my machine to turn on, but not enough to actually play, which renders this AC adaptor completely useless."
2,"This is a wonderful book. I'm always sad to go the Laurie Colwin section in my library and know there will be nothing new, but knowing this book is usually there makes me feel a little better.Polly's conflict is age old. In the middle of a seemingly wonderful life, the ache she feels is really touching. I think the search for her real self and the chaos it creates to the people around her is so funny and sad at the same time. It askes the question: Who am I really?I love Polly's family and the way she relates to each member. As just their Polly, she is ultimate diplomat. The toll this task takes, I think, I something many women can relate to. I know I can. And while I'm not sure an affair is the answer, it fills the emptiness and helps her to realize that she is a person with needs too.I love all of Laurie Colwin's books. This one, though, is my favorite."
2,This deck flashing is far superior to the other brands that sells for the same price. The only brand that I will buy in the future.
2,"As a practicing clinician and a researcher, I had frequently consulted the first edition of Experimental and Clinical Neurotoxicology since its publication in 1980, and I am glad that a new edition has now become available because considerable advances have been made in this field over the past 20 years. Glancing through the pages of the new edition, I note that the editors have kept up the high standard of the earlier work. The text has been thoroughly revised and updated, and new subjects added. I have no doubt that it will continue to be a most authoritative book in neurotoxicology."
2,"I used this calculator for undergraduate work in finance classes. The buttons are large enough for a man's fingers to operate sans pencil eraser. The batteries can be replaced without taking it apart, the keystrokes are well laid out in the manual, and the instructions are easy to understand. We had a contest with the Ti, the HP10 and the HP12s, and I often got the answer first. It made complex calculations seem easy, as if I was ""missing something"", however I arrived at the answers easily. TVM calculations are its forte'."
1,"New viewers during this season must be thinking ""what's all the fuss""? Season 3 is definitely not as good as season 1 and 2 were. We saw some glimpses of melodrama toward the end of season 2 but season 3 gets worse. Lack of acting ability starts to appear especially on behalf of Izzy (while mourning Denny) and George (while mouring his loss). And if I see Meredith sigh and frown one more time I will scream! I'm sticking with it because I heard it gets better. Let's hope so. Meredith's 'drowning' is ridiculous. The kind of thing you'd see on All My Children NOT Grey's Anatomy."
2,"This is definitely one of my favorite ""sci-fi"" movies. Yes, I love the books and the plot of the movie was not exactly ""accurate"", it was true, in some respects, to the spirit of the books. While it was a bit Americanized, the comedy of the movie was pretty solid with amazing visuals and a fun cast.This movie also shows why CGI characters are never better than a well-made puppet. Once you see some of the movie's realization of the Vogons, you'll understand."
2,"Although Mr. Klassen is not a formal theologian (this you can tell by his less-than-systematic, slightly meandering style), he shows his heart for God, ministry and people in this excellent book. Raising more questions than he manages to answer, the author explores what it means to interpret Scripture as a believing Christian while carefully reconsidering a long-held dogma of Christianity. Taking the Gospel of Christ seriously, while rejecting outright literalism with the Bible, Mr. Klassen argues against an eternal hell and in favor of divine justice that is equitable and merciful.While I still believe that ""The Inescapable Love of God"" should be the first book defending Christian Universalism that anyone should read, this title is a very worthy second book on the topic."
1,My son is a Hanuman fan and I got this based on the original Hanuman DVD. This one is some sort of a meld of modern and traditional Hanuman. The story line is bizzare. My son did not like it at all after he watched it. I watched parts of it and thought it was very poorly done.
2,"I stopped buying Paul's records when he was trying to be like Michael Jackson,but when I heard,""The World Tonight,"" on the radio,I thought I'd give him another try. I'm glad I did.This tape is the best Paul has done since,""Band on the Run."" In a way,its sad,because it was the last record he recorded with Linda. Paul's son,James plays a guitar solo on ""Heaven on Sunday,"" and Linda sings backing vocals. What a great song with all three family members working together as a team. My favorite is ""Beautiful Night,"" and the great ending that follows.Ringo's on alot of the songs,playing drums,and singing back up. Steve Miller is also on the album,and Jeff Lynne produces alot of the tracks with Paul. Every song on this tape is the best. You will not be dissapointed buying ""Flaming Pie."""
2,"While not an album it's an excellent single with TDF remixes. The tracks are typical Kraftwerk with their minimalist approach and instantly recognisable style. For Kraftwerk purists the CD is a definitely one for the collection.To the band - Florian, bring on more new music! Awesome concert in Sydney Jan 03!"
2,"A Splendor Of Letters: The Permanence Of Books In An Impermanent World by Nicholas A. Basbanes is an absorbing contemplation of issues concerning books in contemporary society, ranging from the destruction of books and libraries in Sarajevo, Tibet, and Cambodia; to the matter of ""discards"" at various libraries; the many types of materials used to record information from ancient times down to the modern day; debates about preservation whether in regard to storing books on paper or keeping them in electronic format; and so much more. An amazing study of issues critical to bibliophiles worldwide today, A Splendor Of Letters is a seminal and impressive work which is most especially recommended to the attention of dedicated bibliophiles, cultural historians, and Library Science reference collections."
1,"The sheets are listed as fleece but they are paper thin and make flannel look big and fluffy. The ""backside"" is a dreadful synthetic material and feels gross !!"
1,Just got one based upon the reviews and it does not work at all. I tried it in the outlet right next to the one where I had the base unit and it did not work. Waste of time.
1,"I did a test run on Miracle mill ME300 with peanuts. It worked well. Noise is acceptable. It milled peanuts into peanut butter mixed with tiny bits of nuts. I opened and cleaned it up with a brush and dish detergent. 36 hours later, the 2 main parts are already rusted. It is made with cheap iron, not stainless steel. Rust build up so easily and it is hard to clean up. Unless you don't mind using rusted fork and spoon, DON'T BUY IT.THIS IS A FAIL PRODUCT. IT SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET."
2,"Another great Taratino film. Perhaps not the best, but definitely worth watching. All of the performances are top-notch and the dialogue is in-depth, as you'd expect. If you haven't seen it, please do!"
2,This is one of the best albums i have on a record. I would be appriciated to have it on cd.
1,"Horrible product - just a bunch of old footage with commentary by a couple of wankers. Stick with authorized, official RHCP products. This is a waste of time and money."
2,The movie is nothing new and it is very predictable. It's about a girl's fatal attraction to a teacher. I enjoyed Rose McGowen's preformance and did get a chuckle about the bug spray smell in the attic. My only complaint is that it would have been nice to see what exactly she did to her friend.
1,"This book's author needs a bit of a talking to.Yes, let's read a book about kidnapping during sleep right before bed. Great idea. Two year old perfect little girl waited a week for this book. Unbelievable. I am so fn pissed off right now.You idiots looking into deeper meanings into a bedtime story need to stop the 6 cocktails and insecurities thru writing your reviewes.Pathetic"
2,"Bought to supplement my two other phones of the same type. After some searching, thankfully I was able to find this phone on Amazon. These are the best cordless phones I have ever used."
1,"This cd plaer skips all the time even with esp2 on. it just totally sucks when it becomes continuous with the skipping. Skip skip skip skip skip, that's all it does, even with brand new cd's."
2,"Jhumpa Lahiri's ""The Namesake"" begins with the birth of Gogol Ganguli, the son of young Indian parents recently immigrated to Boston. The novel follows the life of Gogol and his identity as a second generation Indian living in the United States with a Russian name, from his childhood to middle age. The life of Gogol, and especially the viewpoint of his parents, are presented in a wonderfully poignant way that is all the more effective for its subtlety - although it is written in a somewhat detached third person form, the powerful way in which the feelings of the characters resonate off the page makes it hard to put down - I went through the life of Gogol in two days and couldn't stop thinking about it for a week afterwards. I would highly recommend this book, especially to other second generation Indians, who may find that they can relate strongly to Gogol's point of view and circumstances."
1,"the waterfall itself is nice, but the pump is terrible. worked for maybe a day then didn't work anymore. keeping the pump where you want it to be is also extremely aggravating. the suction cups that are mounted on the bottom of the pump itself don't seem quite big enough to keep it stabilized in a proper position. I'm not bashing exo terra in any way, i think their products are great, but i haven't had much luck with anything water related and exo terra. look around the web for reviews before you buy this. there's a lot of complaints!"
1,"I bought this phone for the cordless speakerphone feature. All I ended up with was a headache. This first phone continued to fade in and out while you were talking regardless if you held the handset or talked on the speakerphone so it was practically useless. After contacting Panasonic I was sent an exchange refurbished phone (I paid full price for a new phone, not a refurbished one). This one was worst than the first. After charging for 12 hours it will only hold a charge for a 5 minute conversation before dying. I'm very disappointed after spending $50. Please consider a different brand."
1,Worked greast for a couple of weeks then faded little by little...at this rate I'd have to buy two a month. I think I'll just get something bigger and more expensive and leave it in the car over night.
1,"My wife bought this for me for my bday. I was very excited, I made approx. 1 smoothie per day (soft fruits only, no ice) and within 10 days the motor was burned out. The only way I could've been more gentle with this item was to not use it at all, which apparently is what it's intended for. If you want a nice-looking, blender for display only, then this one might be for you. If you want an appliance that you can actually use, you should look elsewhere. I'm going to try an immersion blender for my smoothies."
1,"This is the consumer version of the Nautilus Treadclimber. It's smaller than the Nautilus machine but otherwise very similar.24 Hour Fitness gyms bought a bunch of these a few years back and introduced them with great fanfare.The good news - excellent workout. Far better than treadmills or ellipticals in my experience.The bad news - they were all recalled after most wore out.Nautilus introduced a new improved version. Again - excellent workout. Sadly, again, most wore out.Hopefully someday Nautilus/Bowflex will solve all the problems and release a version 3 that lasts. Till then, given the ""no labor"" and the short hydraulic warranty I'd be very cautious about purchasing one."
1,Very long and takes to long to make its point. Has some good information though. I wouldn't recommend this book.
2,"My son was very excited to get these. They are flimsy, but that is fine for what they are. Kids think they are great. Wish the box wasn't so squished when I got them. The presentaion for a gift wasn't that great."
1,"I was hoping for something that would give me some info on these places. Instead it is just video (a lot of time lapse photography), some of which is pretty cool, with music playing in the background. There is no narration - you have to figure out on your own the location being shown. So if what you are after is something that is relaxing and beautiful to look at then you might find this enjoyable. If you are looking for something that is more informative, look elsewhere."
2,"I loved this movie...and I never buy DVD's. So right there is telling you a lot. Tom Hardy and Gerald Butler are such guy's and little boys in this movie. The rest of the cast are awesome. I hope the make a second one like it says at the end of the movie. The music is awesome in the movie. The realitionships that the characters have works so well. I would reomend the movie ""Snatch"" if you like this one. Seriously you won't be disapointed."
1,"This is the one toy my 4 yr old daughter asked for from Santa. It's dead out of the box. Tomorrow morning I get to try and convince her that Santa is not mad at her and even elves can screw up. Stay very far away from this toy. It is JUNK, and expensive junk at that. As for me, this $70 is the last that Disney will ever recieve from me and my family. With as many bad reviews as this toy has (I should have checked out the reviews before hand.) They know there is a problem with this, yet they allowed it out of the store anyway. TOYSRUS are contempable in my eyes from this point further. Merry Christmas, yeah right... Thanks!"
1,"As several other reviewers mentioned, the unit directions are misleading and confusing. I did figure out how to get it it work and made a stew so delicious, my father compared it to his mother's (the highest compliment you can get in this family). However when I went to clean the unit, I noticed the non-stick surface was bubbling and peeling right off. Awesome - just gave my family cancer with their holiday meal. I am very careful with my appliances and only used wooden utensils and cleaned it with a soapy washcloth, nothing scouring. I am very disappointed and will be returning this ASAP."
2,"Doomsday is coming!This is the first comic book I ever read, shortly after it was released on TPB. Of all the things I read as a kid, this one always stuck with me the hardest.Is it the greatest Superman story ever written? Maybe not. But it's a legendary story for good reason."
1,This movie was awful. The reason I didn't suffer too much is because it did have some good visuals and special effects. That was all this film had that was good. The acting was the worst in years. The story was non-exsistent. Did we even care about any of the characters? And as for the worst of all the villains. They were unintersting and not even worth disliking. This movie was a waste of a lot of money (not just mine) and it seems as it were forced. It does not even deserve the name of star wars.
1,"As Plug and Play items go...it isn't one. My Aptiva 200MMX computer couldn't figure out what I was installing and thought that it was a CD Rom drive. After updating my BIOS and buying an IDE controller card, I thought that I would be in business. Unfortunately, that was hardly the case. My computer now thought that the unit was a 3.5"" floppy drive. Calling DRTech's help line was an exercise in futility (""please leave your name, models#, and problem and we'll get back to you in 24 hours""). Their website was not to be found... at least the website their ""help"" line instructs you to go to. So now I'm buying an external SuperDisk Drive by Imation. I hope that you do likewise."
2,"What separates this book from the other holocaust books is that it does a great job of focusing on life AFTER the holocaust. Kitty Hart spends time in displaced persons camps in Europe, then settles in England only to face a new set of challenges. Her return trip to Auchwitz allows her an opportunity to reflect on life in the death camp, but from the perspective an older individual who can comment on how life in the camp has affected her adult life.Return to Auchwitz is one of the better holocaust books I have ever read, written by a very brave and admirable woman."
2,"I first found out about this book at the library. After utilizing its teachings for 3 weeks, I knew that I needed to own a copy. The practice is useful and the descriptions/explanations are just right. I am proud to own this book."
2,"This movie was as good as the first one. Fans get their first look at Jason, who is avenging his mother's death. Jason was misunderstood. This movie is basically like the first one. Another good horror."
2,"For those who remember the days of Studio 54, and rapid fire dance mixes, there are a few memeories on this CD!!. ""I Should Have Loved Ya!"", Tonight I'm Alright"", ""I Don't Want Nobody Else"" bring back many memories for me. Although they did not receive much radio air play, these songs lit up the dance floors of many disco's. They are just a piece of memorabilia to add to any collection. Also, the rest of the CD is quite good!!!!"
1,this kindle version does not have a table of contents so it is hard to search this version of the book
1,we got this video and it was a bad quality. we tried to get it replaced but didn't get any response from the seller after several tries. we will not knowingly buy from this seller again.
1,"The quality of this product is poor. I wanted something inexpensive for my 8-year-old, but even my 8-year-old son deserved a better sound quality docking station."
2,"What does amazon.com know about Vince Gill? Nothing. Who does know him? We do, his fans! This is his best album. When he sings, ""I found somebody that really does love me...,"" you believe him. After all, I buy Vince Gill CDs precisely for the love songs, and this CD is ""chock full"" of love songs. His last CD was wonderful; however, this CD surpasses that one - this is his best CD yet, to which I say that it's a shame more artists don't produce quality music when they are in love. Best of luck to ya, Vince - you found what we all are searching for - the difference is that you have shared it with us through this CD."
2,"I love this series, period. Im one of those people who not only like action, but likes something that makes you think. This not only makes you think, but gets you thinking about your own existance. Hideaki Anno is one of the greatest dirctors of all time. The way he turns his visions into cinema is unmatched by anyone else. And to think I used to dispise this show on Adult Swim. Its too deep to jump in in the middle of the series let alone not having the ability to rewind if you miss something. It must be viewed in a complete set to be truly understood. You wont regret this purchase!"
1,"Don't buy this one until you find somewhere that you can sample the tracks, such as perfectbeat. I personally like the tracks Skin, Unspeakable Joy, and Command & Obey, but many of the others seem to be the kind of repetitive and non-melodic sounds that I hear at clubs I avoid. (And I already have the tracks I like on other CDs.) Your mileage may vary; that sound may be just what you're looking for. I thought the first volume was a lot better, though."
1,"From the get-go this supposedly new toner cartridge [[ASIN:B000AYMPT0 Canon E 20 - Toner Cartridge - 1 X Black - 2000 Pages] was different from those used in the last 17 years in this extremely nice, durable Cannon photo copier. It copies everything way lighter than ever before. Plus, it's a waste of paper figuring where to set the darkness level. I'm betting it doesn't last long and I'll have purchase a new cartridge..."
1,Very disappointed. Poorly written. Curious where all the quotes were obtained from children of this age in that time period???? Even paper and typeset are very poor quality. Overpriced. Bud and Me a much better choice for this story.
2,I kerp on thing the EyeToy camera was dum but when I played It it was cool.My favrite game is kun-fu.
2,"The first time I read this I was sure that Norman Rockwell had secretly done the illustrations under a pseudonym(not really, but it sure felt like it)! I suddenly had a strong desire to visit Vermont or New Hampshire in Autumn. And the poetry reminded me a bit of Robert Frost, another American original. I wish more parents would read books like this to their children(exposing them to such beautiful art and poetry) instead of the cookie-cutter and contrived picture books we see so common among us today! The twist at the end will make you smile long after you have put the book down."
1,"There are many excellent christian movies, but this is not one. The cinematography is decent, but, except in a few spots, the dialogue, the directing, acting and special effects are close to being simply awful. This reminds me of a rather badly put together high school production."
2,"I love this album as is. I think it sounds about the same as their older stuff. I don't think they have gone downhill. However with losing Tarja, I myself do have my doubts. I think she's irreplacable and they will most likely not find anyone like her again. I tried listening to other music in this genre and I always go back to Nightwish because they are the best there is. Some of their work sounds a bit tribal, but equally wonderful. I think this album is a masterpiece from beginning to end. This band is really talented and as it seems others agree because they are still around."
2,"Becky has captured the feelings of motherhood in all their glory. It's joys and sorrows, the bittersweet knowledge that if we are doing our job right, we are raising our children to leave us. Once again, she uses humor and a profound understanding of humankind to share her story. I laughed and cried with Becky throughout this book. I highly recommend it to anyone who is a mother or who was once a child or who has ever known a child!"
1,"I have a substantial set of Desert Rose made in California that I inherited from a family member. My original set is absolutely beautiful. The craftsmanship is amazing. Each piece has wonderful details in both the texture of the ceramic and the hand painting.This piece is made in China and is NOTHING like the original. The butter dish is clumsy and bulbous. The top of the butter dish does not fit neatly into the bottom but rather flops around. The ""rose"" on top is simply a blob. The painting lacks any kind of detail found in the original. When placed side by side to the original they don't even look like they are part of the same set. Save yourself the disappointment and look for an original replacement piece with a USA backstamp."
1,A white comforter with BIG brown feathers showing and sticking out is not so COMFORTABLE.
2,this book is great! i have read it 6 times and have not gotten tired of it ! i am ten yrs old and i think waht mattie cook did is absolutly incredible. she went trough so much and survied a deadly fever .I mean waht fortenn yr old girl whos mother has the yellow fever and whos grandfather died who took care of little nell and helped three smal children survive the yellow fever ? that girl has to be amazing and i undersatnd that so that is a really amazing girl with an amazing personality ! this story is amazing i really love it !!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,"When decorating my brother-inlaw's condo, we needed a a tall lamp next to the lounge part of the couch. I looked everywhere, in stores and online, and was so happy to find this lamp, as height, size and color of shade were perfect next to the lounge part of the couch. I was even more happy when we opened the box to find it was very well made, with bulbs that could be adjusted for different lighting effects, and bright enough for reading. It looks like a $400.00 lamp you would find in upscale furniture stores."
1,This play had me so confused... What was the writer thinking it had no substance it was horrible could not sit and watch overally dramatic which made it horrible
1,"I don't know where these critics get off comparing this to U2's earlier days. This is not the creative music U2 used to make. U2 borrowed a lot of motown influence for this CD, and instead of going for something exciting, they ""stayed safe"" and made something that will inevitably sell more copy. I'm not impressed. There is nothing groundbreaking about this like the U2 of the Unforgettable fire or even Achtung Baby. One comment: Weak. Pure and simple."
1,"My recommendation is that you shouldn't buy any modem with the name Conexant. This was my fourth Conexant modem, and it was just like all the others. It turns out that all Conexant modems are software based, which means that they put most of their workload on the CPU. This results in frequent crashes, slow connections, and most commonly, frequent disconnects. I hope you take this advice and buy something more reliable, such as Best Data or US Robotics."
2,"The texbook's scope is wide and encompasses algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and various concepts. The last chapter is a preview about calculus. The explanations are lucid and relavant to the exercise sets. In addition, there are numerous mathematical vignettes about concepts and historical people. After the completion of a precalculus sequence, the textbook is excellent as a reference."
2,"Baby, I've never laughed this hard. This is a true work of genius. I never saw the chris rock show so I can say this film stands out on its own merit. If you can only appreciate the mundane kind of jokes you have to rationalize and figure out (or those that need to have gross..content to have effect), then you'll be [upset]like Mr. Wylie below. However, if you wanna get some classic entertainment that's in good taste, you give this one a try."
1,"Did not realize they were located in Hong Kong! Order was lost, but refunded my $! It was a cheap price, but way to far from me lol"
2,"I recommend buying this for the hard rock tracks only. Great testosterone driven grunge dabbing in the arts of metal occasionally on this one. However, on the slower tracks like Payday, Looking Down The Barrel, etc.. It seems they overproduced and made it crappy. Find the demo versions of these songs to download (its incredible how much better the demo of payday is) along with some rarities like New Light, Come Together and make urself the perfect rock mixer cd."
1,"This is just another book that americans like to brag about how their ""brave"" grandfathers were treated poorly by japanese soilders in WW2. Get over it, people. If it wasn't for the jewish men's atom bomb, i'm sure americans lost the war in south pacific, just like they did in vietnam.Btw, What about the Americans dropping two A-bombs and nearly wiped out innocent population in japan? What about all the american G.I's and civilian crimes against native folks in Japan, Korea and south east asian countries that never get reported in major american media? How come there isn't a single book about ugly americans living in oversea?"
1,"Little Giant 5.5-ASP Submersible Sump PumpI have used the Little Giant 5.5 ASP submersible pump only one time and just recently noticed oil in my fountain, thinking my pool man was not cleaning well. Pump was still working until still leaked oil and then pump just died. what a waste of money since just recently replaced the pump and had to pay lots of money for install. And now to think that i have to buy another and have it installed. No way.. i am changing pumps. You are a Little Pea not a Giant."
2,Superb performances by all! Have watched it several times now and always see something different!
1,"You have all heard the expression ""read the fine print"". This whole book is fine print. If your visual acuity is not comparable to that of our feathered friends or rated at 20/10 or better you will need two assistants. One to hold the magnifying glass and another to hold the tightly bound book open. It would be fine for regular reading but NOT sheet music!!! I would have gladly paid the extra bucks to have the material printed in a reasonably sized format such as 8 x ll with a spiral binding. I would give it NO stars and three black holes in this regard. It got 2 stars because the selections and arrangements are good. ..."
1,"I struggled with this one. I found it very difficult to sympathise with either Willis or his wife Jean. By the end of the book I really couldn't have cared less what happened to either of them. Win some, lose some."
2,"This is my 3rd Presto Griddle, but 1st Tilt'n Drain Big. If you can't decide which to buy, go with this one. For the price difference you'd be nuts not to. Between deer hunting, pheasant hunting and fishing in Canada, I spend about 30 days a year cooking for at least 10 people a day plus cooking at home. It makes a difference. Heats up quickly and holds heat consistantly."
2,"I truly love this album. I've had this in my CD player for weeks now at work and not one single co-worker has complained that it just keeps playing over and over and over. Which should be enough of an endorsement in itself, but I'll continue:The first time I listened to it, I sampled a few songs and thought it was okay. My first impression was not to be blown away, not to put it in my CD player on permanent repeat, not to tell everyone I could find to purchase it themselves.My first impression was dead wrong. The more you listen the more caught up in the music you get. The songs are infectious and you can't help moving your head along in time to the music (looking slightly reminicent of a bobble head while doing so is simply a sad side effect.)I truly enjoy every song on the album. And I urge everyone out there not only to buy this album, but to join me in buying two copies of whatever comes next from Mr. Schott."
2,"I bought this toy for my daughter for Christmas. It looks like she will have a lot of fun with it, especially because she has other vehicals that can go along the track.She really likes Dora and when I saw this I knew she would be happy with it. Now I can't wait until she gets to open it Christmas day!"
1,The title should properly read 'The Purpose Driven Life for Fundamentalist Christians' because that is who it is written for. Anyone hoping to discover some system for spiritual growth or understanding will be disappointed. The author's own understanding of God is of the 'Jesus wants you for a sunbeam' variety. Not very deep. And not for Hindus or any other religion. They presumably are going somewhere else.
1,"Consolidating the accomplishments of one of the greatest bands in rock 'n' roll history onto one CD is criminal. Rhino Records does a great job with their ""Complete Greatest Hits,"" etc., but this collection is incomplete, misrepresentative, and poorly arranged. Songs like ""Doolin' Dalton"" make the cut, but ""In the City"" (which, for some reason, was not on the second Greatest Hits collection) is again overlooked. Admittedly, the Eagles have had some strange collections (""After the Thrill is Gone"" being included on the second Greatest Hits despite its 1975 release). So, because my review has been as helter-skelter as the arrangement of tunes on this CD, I will leave you with the recommendation of buying the individual albums or Greatest Hits collections."
1,"it's such a hard task to combine sex and the spiritual that I wish writers gave up trying! there is one single idea in this book (fallen angel falling in love with human) and this is not really worth the trouble, the rest is decoration and the desperate attempt to create a Anne-Riceish atmosphere. fake philosophy, fake emotions, dreadful ""theology"" and bad storytelling too.one star for the wings though: they are pretty!"
1,"As R G-S has already said, the Miles Davis version of IN A SILENT WAY is far better than Joe's version. This is a painfully dull record. I wish Joe had written some thru-written stuff instead of boring me to tears with these aimless improvisations. HIS LAST JOURNEY is a bit of low-key impressionism that might interest you if you're a fan of Richard Strauss's tone-poems. (Luckily, I'm not.)"
1,"I purchased a winder that was supposed to be ""like new"". The unit arrived and was old, used and missing the front cover. The insert that holds the watch was worn and worthless. I was able to get my money refunded and return the winder. Alls well that ends well. I will buy new from now on."
1,"I owned 2 of these units in the space of 6 months. When the first one had problems after a few months, I assumed I had just overworked it or gotten water into something vital. The second unit didn't last 2 months before it started doing the same thing the first one did (the 'on' light flashing not allowing a reset without unplugging and reconnecting the unit). I went to HB's web site and e-mailed customer service a thorough description of the problem. I NEVER received an e-mail response. I did receive a packet of coffeemaker de-scaler in the mail with no accompanying correspondence. Believe me when I say, as a coffee maker/drinker for over 45 years, I KNOW when a coffeemaker needs de-scaling and can handle that without help. That will be my last Hamilton Beach appliance due to a total lack of customer service."
2,"Truth is stranger than fiction in Mr. Mckenna's personalaccount of a quest for knowledge deep in the heart of thePeruvian rainforest. Encountering such strangness as indigenous shamens to hyperdimensional beings, this book may very well cause you to ponder investigating ""Just what is reality, anyway?"" In the annals of psychedelic liturature, this book is a classic."
2,"This is a scholarly and fact-focused treatment of a subject that has often been treated in a way that is meant to support a particular author's theoretical framework. The subject is complicated, and the book does a good job of dealing with the facts. As is so often the case, the most valuable part of the book is the commentary it elicits, so if you're going to go to the effort of reading the book, take the extra ten minutes to read whatever commentaries/reviews it gets, too. Just the ones on Amazon are pretty helpful for putting it in context.dgc"
2,"I can not believe how fast we got it, and it was exactly what we wanted. Thank you! A very satisfied customer."
2,"How my ratings work:5 - I really liked/loved it4 - I liked it3 - Could've been better/worth a look2 - Just didn't live up to the potential1 - Simply awfulGabriel Iglesias is one funny dude. He has a lot of energy for a fluffy guy. I remember him when he was on the Nickelodeon show All That and he was funny on there. I didn't see anything of him for a couple years until I saw him on Comedy Central Presents (which was awesome). This routine is even better, partly because it's longer than the last one, and because it's got funnier stuff. He's great with impersonations, goofy voices, and sound effects. I hope to see more of him in the future, both in stand up and movies."
2,"It's been over a year, so my memory of much of this book is fuzzy. That said, John Howard Yoder's contribution, Practicing the Rule of Christ, is worth more than its weight in gold. The article was originally written as a study guide on forgiveness, complete with study questions. Some additional material was added a bit later in a more standard essay form. This article was, without any doubt, the most provocative thing I've read in quite some time. The ideas from it still swirl around in my head on a regular basis.Plenty of other good stuff on Christian conception of virtues as well."
2,"One hot summer day in Times Square, New York City, a girl with a passion for rock and punk slipped into a record store to buy a CD. What she found was a freaking good album by New Found Glory. My name is struckachord and I have a problem. I love these songs. They're so addictive and hardcore, but nothing that I've never dealt with before. Some of the songs make me want to scream, they're so real. I was really impressed by Jordan's voice and the rest of the band's instrumental achievements. Ballad for the Lost Romantics hit home, Dressed To Kill just kicked butt, Sucker made me laugh and disturb more than a few people on the plane home. (Including the cute guy reading A Tale of Two Cities next to me) Ah well, such is the life of a girl who loves rock."
1,"I was looking for a gas grill/stove combo and settled on the road trip grill. Lots of good reviews, now here's the down side: It is clunky to set up, pretty much takes two people if you want to fold it up without dropping it. The grill has a very wide solid ring around the flame ring which doesn't allow drippings to flow down and smoke, it also clogs up with burned fat. You need to look at one to see what I mean. Sorry, it just didn't suit me."
2,IT ARRIVED PROMPTLY IN GREAT CONDITION :0) ONE OF THE FUNNIEST MOVIES BY ONE OF THE FUNNIEST MEN OF ALL TIME!
1,"I was shocked when I came across the author's pro-heroin web site, and the author's degrees mean nothing. Anyone can go through the educational system and acquire degrees with half a brain, but common sense and heart, you either have them or you don't. Does he have kids/grandkids? What I find extremely suspect is the lack of negative reviews of the book and doubt, because of this, that mine will be/remain posted. This guy's ""book"" is a lot of dangerous nonsense in the hands of any young person wanting to justify the use of this horrifically dangerous, life-wasting drug."
2,"More like 4 1/2.gurus pretty much a legend to his new unheard of type of music. His new style of hip hop which he calls jazzmatazz, was good throughout his whole trilogy, this time its a little different. He ditches the jazzmatazz style a little, and goes back to the times of gang starr, and modernizes it. Although a little disapointed, i thought this album was pretty phat my self."
1,MULTIPLAYER IS STILL NOT AVAILABLE 3 Months after the release. They even included a nice note saying multiplayer would be available shortly in a patch. It has been 3 months.. 3D0 has lost this long time HOMM fan.Where can I return this piece of patchware.
2,"This is a wonderful story that chronicles the life of Col. Charles McGee who holds the record for the highest three-war total of fighter combat missions in US Air Force history. It is told through the eyes of his daughter who captures both the military experience as well as the human side of this story. We learn of the perseverance of this Tuskegee Airman who was able to overcome racist experiences and become an American hero. Part of the delight of this book is the personal rememberances by family and friends. Col. McGee flew combat missions and navigated racist attitudes and biases throughout his life. This account is about more than a distinguished military career,it is about family and the significant influence he had on his eldest daughter. We learn about his bravery but more importantly lessons about the value of family, character, and education shape a powerful message for all of us."
1,"Having read ""The Shell Seekers"" many years ago, I was looking forward to a rewarding summer read. There was much potential in each of the characters but very little development, with the minor exception of Lucy.Everything was entirely to predictable and tied together much to neatly.I would not spend the money on the hardcover version-wait for the paperback!"
1,"Even on my pc, the detail is pretty poor.(like where a creek name goes to,lack of trails and roads) It's even worse on my handheld gps. I'll wait for a 1 to 24000 scale for my particular region."
1,"Like the other reviewer I am having problems with some of the containers not sealing correctly. In my case, 2 of the 4 containers will not hold a vacuum. The leak appears to come from inside the pumping mechanism. I do like the basic design but the quality control seems poor."
1,Sabrent USB-2535 Hi-Speed USB 2.0 to IDE Cable for 2.5-inch/3.5-inch/ 5.25-inch Drives & Devices With POWER AdapterThis item is not compatable with 2.5 inch drives as advertised
2,"Great film but too intense to watch. The main character goes through heavy emotional breakdown, a seizure like attack that was apparently caught on camera, which I found to be too disturbing, yet insightful and well fitting to the story. There's a lot more to this story, sometimes even odd humor, weird encounters with real-life characters and heavy, original images of the 9/11 disaster sites. If everything out there right now didn't already feel like a nightmare it might even have been easier to watch but what do we watch on the news everyday?"
1,"I have had this brush for about two months.I read the reviews but thought if i did as the instructions read, that it should last. I was wrong. I washed the brush to get the loose hair out, dry it and lay it on its side as instructions suggest.Even after 2 months it is loosing the hair bristles. Every use three or more hairs fall out. I am going to buy another one , but not this brand."
1,"I was very disappoined in the product. It turned out to be plastic, not ceramic like I the one I had purchased in the past. I went back to the site and could not find where the seller states that the product is plastic. It does not compare to the ceramic Lighthouse Bird Feeder I currently own. The seller should identify this item as plastic and not have it a suprise to the buyer when it arrives at their home."
2,"I can't imagine a more limiting instrument than a music box -- its tones are set in a specific pattern, and it doesn't deviate from that at all. But Colleen somehow makes music boxes magical again. By mixing the traditional plucked sounds with their re-processed and synthesized counterparts, she manages to evoke a fairy tale mysticism. ""What's is a Componium, Part 1"" goes from thick sonics to singular tones at the end. And even it ""Charles's Birthday Card"" relies solely on iterations of Pop Goes the Weasel, ""Will You Gamelan For Me?"" is its own creation immediately. The tinkling comes fast and furious on ""What's is a Componium, Part 2,"" a track that sparkles like moondust. ""Calypso in a Box"" shows off the more processed side, and has an almost Senor Coconut feel for its short running time. The standout piece here is the final track, ""I'll Read You a Story,"" which appeared on an earlier album, but is always welcome anywhere."
1,"I tried the Scott Cole beginning Tai-Chi(excellent) and figured this was more instruction and all 24 poses. Yes, she does the poses but it is impossible to follow. The camera angles do not allow for the study of the hand or feet positions and she offers no explaination., This is a complete waste of money. I am returning it to Amazon for my 50% loss."
1,"The only reason I watched this movie was because it was an HD DVD-great picture and sound. The plot is similar to Aliens, but without any suspense, thrills, or humor. I love the Rock and he is fine, but the movie was just plain boring. I was more creeped out by the Doom 3 video game. The only reason to watch this movie is if you are starved for HD DVD content."
2,great eucational games my children do not even relize they are learning
2,"I was satisfied with the order of the book, The Death of Manolete. The book was new as described, and the delivery of the book was prompt.PBR"
2,"it is small......but once you put it one,you will fall in love.wear it alot just for the conversation sometimes"
1,Plane was broken during the packing process before it was shipped. Its not worth the time/effort to complain/return. Was a little disappointed.These following words were added to get word count above the twenty or so words required in order to post this message.
1,This toy used to engage my baby about a 15 minutes or so..He played with it in his early phase of 1st year(around his 6th month-8thmonth)..and babies are very intelligent in understanding thefirst in first out surprise of this gumball..This product ENHANCES MEMORY part of the kids!The make is excellent. Colors are bright.
1,There a lot of issues with the last firmware for this player.1. Slow skip forward/backward2. MP3 tags doesn't work
2,"This is surely not one of the best books of Andy McNab.Liberation Day is a funny book with nice characters and Humour.The Story is not so great as Crisis Four or Firewall, but it's a good read and worth the money."
1,"I am just recently venturing into the world of digital music and MP3 players. Being technology-ignorant, I wanted simple but comprehensive instructions on how I could upload my CD music library onto my new MP3 player and on how to create playlists. But all the information I found--online, in magazines, books--was geared specifically to IPods (a brand I had decided against as too expensive). After extensive searching, I finally found this book & hoped it would help. Unfortunately, the book was worthless to me. Despite being a ""For Dummies"" style book, some parts were incomprehensible or unnecessarily complicated. The rest of the information was hopelessly outdated. For others searching for similar help, keep searching--don't bother with this book."
2,"by reflecting the tension everyone in it is under while they prepare and prepare and wait and wait for something to happen? The agony of anticipation and the unknown. Then the suddeness of what does happen. Norman Mailer does this very well and I especially liked that there were no answers to anything - just life in a brutal situation. And it goes on....Don't misunderstand me, for me it was a page turner. I thought it was great."
1,As a diehard Deathlands fan I'm more than disappointed with this book. It's very poorly written. I hope they never use this ghost writer again.
2,"I found this book hard to put down. I think it's quite astonishing that nobody else has ever written a biography on Scipio Africanus. This book portrays Scipio Africanus as a great general, a better than Napoleon. The other books I recommend for anybody that read this book and liked it to read Hannibal by Theodore Ayrault Dodge."
1,"Well, I read the reviews and still purchased the set. Shame on me. I was hoping we would be one of the lucky ones to get a good set but we didn't. Not only was it terribly difficult to put together (ours seemed to actually have two incorrect numbers) but it was flimsy and didn't really work at all. The track is much to wobbly to withstand any real momentum that the car gets and Lightning didn't make it around the top of the set even ONE time. Some of the pieces never really clicked properly either - very poorly designed. I also didn't test it until tonight (just 6 days BEFORE Christmas - again, shame on me) so now I have to figure out what to get as the ""big"" present. Hopefully, I can still get a refund since I waited so long to test it. We definitely received one of the defective sets."
2,"If you're expecting a fantasy like ""Enchanted"", stay away from this film but if you want a cautionary tale of the future like ""Blade Runner"", check this one out. This was one of the best films of 2006 and that's due to excellent direction and a steller cast headed by Clive Owen, Julianne Moore & Michael Caine in role inspired by John Lennon. I haven't read the book but after seeing this fine film, I will definitely search it out. The immigration and the over-population problems shown in this film hit close to home. I hesitated in seeing this film late at night after work but the reality of this film really woke me up!! This film in HD DVD since after seeing it a second time, I was amazed at the visual richness this film actually has!! Totally recommended for fans of sci-fi and ""Blade Runner"" fans (Bush and other politicos be aware of what you're doing to this planet!!) The HD-DVD transfer gives you a ""you are there"" look too."
2,"I first heard this CD when my daughter was two months old. One day my normally happy baby was inconsolable; you know the scene -- cranky baby, frazzled mother, the loop of tension that feeds on itself. I put the CD on and let the sounds wash over us.My baby quieted down almost immediately and snuggled into me as I rocked her. She listened to the first few songs attentively. The music mellowed her and she slowly, sweetly drifted off. I took a nap with a little angel in my arms. It was a wonderful bonding experience.Susie's lovely voice lulls babies to dreamland very peacefully --and calms moms also.Together we listen to Sleepy Eyes' sweet songs -- these aren't your typical overplayed lullabies -- and now my baby recognizes the tunes, which have become part of our beddy-bye routine.We received this CD as a gift and I highly recommend it. Buy it for yourself. Buy it for new parents. Buy it for the little one you love."
2,"Ditto everything said re ""The Great Omission"" by Willard. This is the first one my husband read (borrowed) from our pastor. Awesome. Highly recommended reading for the serious bible scholar."
2,"It's been said that Whitesnake is much classier than most 'other' hair bands that emerged in the '80's.Isn't that just ANOTHER way of saying they're more mainstream?I've always been a fair weather Whitesnake fan.I mean,ever since they released 'Slide It In'(their best ever lp),they've proved to be the most mainstream,commercial and straight ahead band in rock&roll.Keep in mind that if vocalist David Coverdale didn't look as good as he did,Whitesnake wouldn't have made it AS big as they did.I think a lot of people will agree with me on that.Don't get me wrong,their music is good,not great but good.As for the good songs,they're all here,like ""Still Of The Night"",the rather bluesy ""Love Ain't No Stranger"",the unreleased ""Lookin' For Love"",""Slide It In""(my personal Whitesnake favorite),""The Deeper The Love"",""Slow And Easy"",""Judgement Day"" and ""Fool For Your Loving"".Finally got to see them headline awhile back and in concert,they still kick some serious ass."
2,This game is a lot of fun. It reminds me of grand theft auto vice city. It's hard to find your way back to check off points.
2,"This is a very well-made movie which follows the book as written by Frederick Forsyth in most ways. The book is much more moving and emotional, since Forsyth can use many words to describe a scene which, on film, has to be portrayed only with a facial expression. Even so, Jon Voight does an excellent job with his role and gives a performance that exactly captures Peter Miller's obsessive, doggedly-determined, even when facing death, quest for answers.Whether or not you've read the book, you really need to watch this movie and see for yourself what a great espionage story is like when done without tons of gadgets, super-human (ie: impossible in real life) stunts and computer effects. This movie was done when all that actors and directors had to work with was their own ability at delivering a good movie. The whole cast, but especially Voight, do a superb job. I'm very happy to have this movie in my collection, to accompany the book in my bookcase."
2,"If you are reading the reviews of this novel, most likely you already know the Saint-Germain series. This is an excellent addition to your bookshelf. Who but Yarbro would research the social history of the lands along the Silk Road as they were in the aftermath of a natural disaster that caused world-wide famine--and then share it with the rest of us in such an entertaining and haunting fashion? It's hard to say at this point whether I read these novels--and I read the first one to come out all those years ago and every other since then-- because I love the Count or the History. This one serves up both in gourmet style."
1,"Sent item back to the company and got a rejected mail saying, ""COMPANY OUT OF BUSINESS, RETURN TO SENDER"". The company address on the label is:Recoton Accessories, Inc.2950 Lake Emma RoadLake Mary, FL 32746.Made in China"
2,They look good and they smell good and my very picky German shepherd loves them as well. I will be buying these in the future and her poops are great! My dog and I LOVE them!!!
2,"We were really pleased with the quality of this product. The projection feature of this brand/model clock is far superior to the previous brand we owned. My husband has difficulty getting to sleep and the ""Spa sounds"" feature has definitely proved it's worth. We strongly recommed this product. Also, we received the product well before the expected delivery date. Excellent service from Amazon."
1,I could not finish this book it was disgusting. I hope the movie was not as graphic and gross.
1,"Book has little information about Brackett, or his work. Not a reference at all, and the few cards shown are reproduced terribly. I can't understand how even the most avid Brackett or Monhegan fan could buy it after looking at it. Duh, dumb me. The perils of buying ""virtually""."
1,"Any fan of Caddyshack should stay away from this DVD. this is a sad attempt to market a movie without putting any effort into reformatting it for DVD. There is no widescreen, scenes have been deleted, and there are even some wavy artifacts from what appears to be a Video to DVD transfer. Extremely disapointing END"
1,"Ordered women's sandals (said so in the description), but received MEN's sandals. :( In picture they look almost white and gray. They were camel colored and black. Not what I expected."
1,"I was kind of surprised that this movie was highly rated. I thought it was bad. The acting was good but the plot was ridiculous and all I could think the entire movie was, 'why did Emily Blunt do this film?' It was boring and the plot was really stupid and the end was one of those - is she or isn't she- which I find obnoxious."
2,This movie is SO funny.Ace Ventura:When nature call. Is so funny it felt like my ribs were being pulled out of my body.This is a must see.
1,"Ok. If you like to have endings to your films and like some sort of logic in your films then this Cube isn't for you. If you like open-ended films and don't want to know why things work and how it ends, then it might be to your liking.This was better than Cube2. But that's not saying much. I agree with another poster that the scenes in the cube look more professional and the ones outside the cube look for Sci-fi Channel movie like. Which is bad.I also like to see the little guys win so that is another reason why I disliked Cube3 and Cube2. I can't remember Cube1.The special effects are decent. And that's the only good thing."
1,"This is by far the 2nd most boring ""album"" ever. (Pink Floyd's ""Meddle"" being first) First off, the musicians. Just because you're technical doesn't mean your good! Second off, the lyrics. So cheesy. Yet NONE of you realize this. And finally, the SINGER!!! GOD is he bottom of the barrel ABYSMAL or what?! The only, and I mean only reason to buy this or the aforementioned ""Meddle"" is if you need a cure for insomnia. Both of these will put you to sleep for at least a month! At least that's what happened to ME with ""Meddle""! Avoid not even at all costs otherwise."
1,This is not a complete version of the original LP. It is sadly truncated and missing at least one key track. Beware.
2,"Obviously not Oscar worthy material here but the story had potential to be better given what they were working with. Other than that it's pure B-movie fun. sit back, have a few laughs and don't be overly sensitive as this is a little racist and bigotted at times. its all in good fun though and they manage to spread it around; everyone is the butt of the joke at some point. ""The United States of America does not negotiate with terrorists""...best line of the movie, pure comedic goal right there."
1,"The first time I heard of ""Turk"" was on The ""Hot Boyz"" ""I Need a Hot Girl"" back in 1999, then his first LP ""Young and Thuggin'"" in 2001. Now he jumps off with ""Still a Hot Boy"" after all most a decade, he still claims to be down with a crew that spill 7-8 years ago. Turk is a piece of s*** the only hot track has to be 16, don't be fooled by the reviews here cop his first Album."
2,"The 7"" disks are the best furniture sliders available for two reasons; First, the larger the better. The more surface area you have, the easier it is to move the object. Second, the slick plastic. We were even able to move a heavy tv across the tile floor. They are definitely worth buying, just toss the small disks."
2,"If you want to learn about wine...Mark is the guy you want to learn it from. He's laidback, funny, articulate, and completely versed in wine. No matter your experience or knowledge base with wine, you will come away with KEY points to make your wine tasting and drinking, a fabulous and memorable experience. I have personally gone to his classes on wine---the ones upon which this video were based---they were wonderful. Thanks Mark!"
1,"I purchased this product at a local chainstore before the beginning of school. I am a college student taking 4 classes 2 days a week so I needed something that would hold a fair amount of paper for note taking, as well as class work and handouts. After less then 4 months of usage this binder has completely fallen apart. It holds a lot but what difference does that make when the vinyl cover holding it all together has come apart. Hopefully spending the extra few dollars on the heavy duty binder by Avery will provide better results for this coming semester of college. If you are only using this to sit on a shelf in an office then this binder will serve you well otherwise look for something designed for real use."
2,This is my second pair of ER6i's (lost the first or would still have them). I have used this model of earphone for over 3 years. Mostly used for under helmet on long motorcycle rides with my Zune and iPod Touch. Also work great for isolating yourself from a snoring spouse. They take some getting used to since they have to be good and snug in the ear canal. Finding the right ear tip is the key and there are several choices provided with the earphones. Replacement tips are also very affordable. You can't go wrong with these as long as you can tolerate having them in ear (way in ear).
1,"i loved the first mummy movie and had very high expectations for the second, even though i missed it in the theaters. The day it was released on dvd, i ran out to get it to find my local store sold out. My roomate however manged to snag it for his collection and upon watching it that nite, was glad that fate stopped me from buying a truly overrated , summer popcorn flick.special effects were a plenty but def. less striking than the first one, the computerized scorpion king at the end was almost as bad as the computerized satan at the end of SPAWN. the story was kinda weak. But its a sequel i guess.Dont waste your time. rental only or wait for it on TNT."
1,"As recently reviewed for 'Fingerboard Tape: Yellow' don't buy this to use on a stringed instrument. It doesn't stick for long and when it does, it takes the varnish off of the neck of the violin when you remove it. No good for anyone who rents an instrument at least... I don't think it is a product specifically designed for string playing... perhaps for a painter or artists."
2,"My daughter (almost 2 years old) adores this book! We borrowed it from our library and it quickly became a part of her bedtime routine. It is simple with not a lot of overwhelming colors, patterns, shapes, etc. Just the alphabet and some cute dogs. It has helped us in teaching her to pronunciate her letters. I had to add it to her Amazon wish list because I'm not sure we can give it back to the library? lolI definitely recommend this as a great ABC board book!"
2,I would highly recommend any engineering student to read this book before taking any core engineering class.
1,"Battery gave out fairly quickly before it wouldn't hold a charge for less than five seconds. I had to open it up to fix and decided it wasn't worth spending the money to buy a new battery and solder it back on, instead I by passed the battery and applied 5V directly to the trimmer. Putting it together though was hard as once you open it stuff moves around because as aforementioned it is cheaply made. Would not recommend because it could not tolerate a once a week trim for a more than a few months. Also it cannot be used while charging so once you batteries blow you lose your trimmer essentially."
2,"THE VIDEO NOW IS GREAT MY, FOUR YEAR OLD LOVES IT.HE TAKES IT EVERY WERE, HE GOT IT FOR EASTER."
1,"I think these had been sitting around in a warehouse for a long time, because it took them a long time to send it to me and, when I got it, the tea tasted like cardboard. I've had red rasberry leaf tea before, so I know it's not supposed to taste like this..."
1,I have had the unit for about 2+ years. It is a very good 'blower'. For the first time in the 2 years I've owned it I decided to vacuum some leaves. There must have been a clump of wet ones that got sucked up into it. Within seconds the motor began to burn up. I noticed one of the blades had broken too. With the broken blade it caused it to be unbalanced and consequently did not function well. Conclusion: good blower but be wary of using it as a vacuum.
1,"When I bought home the 7 CD pack, I opened it immediately. I just wanted to know how the vocabulary builder helps an average english speaking adult, like myself.I tried the CD 5, a vocabulary builder. I realized it was for real rookies (read: grade 1 kids). The flash cards had cards for such mundane words like: eating, drinking, supermarket, trees etc... hope you are getting the drift. At about 200 words/flash cards maximum - taught through 9 different entry points, the content doesn't justify 600+MB of space it occupied on the CD (Remember Microsoft Encarta originally came in 1 CD). Amazing is that how they wasted valuable space to store .wav files for nearly 3 dozen languages to teach from! As noted by other reviewers, this is a hotchpotch collection. If this is what I sampled, I am not even wasting my time opening other CDs.You are better off reading books."
1,"Sorry - there is no forgiving the editing of this DVD. It is in a word infuriating. There is no way to connect with the living, performing musicians on stage ""captured"" (presumably) by the cameras. The editing is an object lesson in how to wreck performance footage. I find it hard to believe that the creative forces behind Iron Maiden talked themselves into this massacre of the footage.Add to that (or subtract rather) that the sound is thin and I guarantee I will never watch it again. I didn't even make it thru once. This product should be taken off the market and redone. Period."
1,This was a huge waste of money. They cut my fingernails at all. The clippers are too weak. You can just tell by picking the set up that it's cheap
1,"FROM BUTTERCUP'S HUBBY: This game is very disappointing. I have bought all of the Medal of Honor games and each has been better than the last---until this one. They are just trying to extend the brand while they work on the PS3 and Xbox games. No new weapons, no new scenarios, not very challenging, very average. Rent it, don't buy it. There is a reason why this game is opening at $39 bucks when all of the others started at $49---it's Rocky V."
1,Truth is I really didnt need all the features. I just needed something to wake me or if I roll over before the alarm goes off tell me how much time i have till it does. For me at least the display is impossible to read and so I wear my watch to bed.Otherwise its a nice looking unit that appears well made. I'll keep looking for that perfect Alarm and this one will find its way into the closet.
1,"They put 48 songs on this set but leave off ""Planet Hotdog""!!! Why can we not get the entire soundtrack? After ""Planet Schmanet Janet"", it is supposed to go right into ""Planet Hotdog"" and they CUT IT OFF!!! This really cheeses me off to no end!!!"
1,"Under the cabinet seems to only add more static!!! Sending this back right away, my wife wanted this solely for the Radio and her stations are static whereas my little Clock radio seems to pic up the stations perfectly!"
1,"I was attracted to this book because I was turning 50 and finding it unexpectedly disturbing. The book was interesting enough but not very useful. I didn't really find out anything I didn't already know - other than there were a lot more women out there who were going through, or had been through, a similar re-evaluation. So while it was vaguely comforting, it wasn't at all inspiring or particuarly helpful. I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone who hasn't had a traditional married-with-kids-plus-career lifestyle."
2,"My 22 month old grand daughter was in love with this ""first"" baby doll. It was just the right size for a little girl. It smells yummy (vanilla) and she loved that the eyes closed when she laid the baby down."
1,"my 4 year old just got this as a gift - was frustrating to put the track together and there is zero interaction! The train is self sufficient and just does the same thing on its own over and over - I'm not sure who designed this, but getting the track to fit together was no easy task! We have the wooden and we're going to stay with the wooden!"
1,"The first two singles from this set are awful. I'm hoping that they release ""Upgrade U"". That's the only hot track on this album, in my opinion. I wish Beyonce' all the best, but I wish I wouldn't have purchased this one. Maybe it will grow on me over time...."
2,If you like opera you must purchase this recording. Music and singing are excellent. It is verismo at its best.There is dramatic tension through the opera and the tragic ending is very moving. A huge praise to Marco Polo for making this opera Known to a wide audience.
2,"I love this flatware. I have to agree with others who have bought it, however in one respect: the knife blades tend to pit easily. I simply wash those by hand. It's a nice weight and very goodlooking."
2,"I am a college professor. I have been having my classes read this book for the past 5 years. It is one of the best books that students can read in order to answer the question: Why am I in college?To Learn. Most people emphasize the adventures and overlook the simple beauty of the book, i.e. lifelong learning. This book is a testament to the process of continuous learning throughout your life. College is where you start to put together the skills that you will use to learn for the rest of your life. It is my contention that I have learned more since I earned my Ph.D. than I did before. Feynman demonstrates that as long as you are alive, you are learning. A simple message indeed: enjoy learning."
2,"This is a tale of a young deposed ruler's quest to regain his rightful crown by collecting a rebel army to oppose the evil warlords and wizard who betrayed his father. OK, that's not original, but this is well-executed. The animation is well done in distinctive colors that give it a special beauty, especially the almost pure pastels of the city and palace. Several memoralable characters enliven the tale with crisp dialog and distinctive personalities.The movie sequel, not quite as good, and a direct to video (OVA) followup story are (at this writing) not available on DVD, only VHS."
1,Its a RTS. Not a RPG. And a not very fun one at that. All you do is run and gun. It's bad.
2,"Recently the teenie boppers have been clogging up the airways, and it's nice to hear some good rock music. Blink 182 delivers. Though the CD is relatively short, I found myself listening to it just about everyday. This album has some great lyrics and is actually FUNNY. There are many songs of high-quality. If you like ""what's my age again,"" and ""all the small things,"" this CD will not disappoint."
1,For grades 8-10? Only if your kid is all about graphic masturbation and talking like a truckstop hooker. This series is just garbage that was either written by said truckstop hooker or by a lonely shut in who never had friends and imagines this is is what the cool kids did. Dont waste you money or give your kids the impression that highschool is all about booze and sex and being annoying. Thats what college is for.
2,"I've been a Celtic music fan for many years, long before it began to turn up on the New Age charts. While I don't mean to knock that genre (which has given some splendid traditional musicians -- e.g., the O'Domhnaills of Nightnoise and Alasdair Fraser of Skyedance -- the wider listenership they deserve), traditional Celtic music is an altogether grittier, funkier breed.Ciaran Carson brings a poet's sensibility to the performer's-eye perspective of Irish music, from last night's fun to the next morning's rude awakening. Irish music isn't simply the tunes themselves; it's the old-timers who performed them, the instruments they played, the pints of Guinness, the choking smoke in the bar and the pouring rain outside, and Carson conveys the whole experience admirably. It's almost as good as being there."
2,"This novel elegantly portrays the psychological impact that segregation had on those who lived through it-and on the rest of us by association. It is an excellent narrative of our struggles with memory and its hold on our present selves. As an oral historian, I find that this novel breathes life into the painful stories of segregation that I encounter regularly. A must read for anyone who cares about America and the necessary healing our difficult history demands.Finally, Fortune's prose is both lyrical and concise-overall, a thoroughly satisfying read."
2,"Received this product, and all things I order from Amazon, in very timely fashion. Candex simply works in my system. I live with a high level of yeast, which causes all kinds of troubles, and Candex is the only item that I have found that destroys the cell walls of the yeast so the yeast killers I take can do their job and I can flush the yeast from my system. I don't think I will ever get rid of the yeast completely, but Candex has made my life SO much nicer. The price from Amazon is the big reason I purchase this item, and many others from Amazon. Thank You Amazon!!!!"
2,"I brought this book to parties it was so difficult to put down.Changing the Jewish Characters to Mice made it a little easier to swallow, but when I thought about these characters as real people who lived and died, it hit me in the gut. Then, when I replaced the characters with people in my own family, it brought tears to my eyes. Unthinkable, painful stuff."
2,"I just got this game for Christmas and i enjoy playing it so much. It keeps you moving around, and it's a great workout too! Especially on workout mode. It's great to be able to play such a fun arcade game, right in the comfort of your home. I also like using the dance pads more than a controller because it gives you a challenge!To anyone who likes to move around and dance, i recomend this game with two thumbs up!"
1,"do NOT purchase this translation. it makes one of the funniest writers of all time boring. this translation is as bad as the previous reviewers have indicated. the best, and most hilarious, translation that i've seen is a 1938 version that , i think, eugene o'neill worked on as an editor or something. however, aristophanes should definitely be checked out by afficionados of ancient greek literature as well as anyone interested in comic writing that'll make you laugh out loud. he's one of the titans of world literature."
1,"I got my RN175 from the home depot for one penny when I bought a skid of nails and I think I overpaid for this tool. It does not hold up to industrial standards. Also, when I took it in for repair the parts were more expensive than comparable parts of other brands. I have found that you end up paying in the long run with higher repair costs, more downtime, and poor reliability. I should have stuck with Hitachi."
2,"A good read about Sissy LeBlanc in the small Louisiana town of Gentry losing her virginity and finding the soulmate that she thought she lost in high school. The story will keep you fascinated until the end. I had difficulty with the relationship that Sissy had with her father-in-law. The relationship with the father-in-law was really a turn off but it makes for a great story.Also the story was not era appropriate in some places. The timeframe was the 1940's and 1950's and the story referenced a naugauhyde chair in the 1950's. Naugauhyde was not invented or used in chairs until the late 1960's and also Clara and Sissy referred to Parker as a stud in the 1950's. The word stud was really not used in the 50's. However, if you want to read a novel about love conquering all and with some intrigue too, then this book is captivating."
1,"Believe me, I have been a great fan of DCT, but this one was a little bit of a disappointment. I've also heard the Japanese version and all the songs were great, in Japanese. It's just that in this English version, it sounds too foreign and unnatural, perhaps because translating every single word does not always work and sounds too awkward. It doesn't seem to blend into other American pops."
1,"I've recorded about 120 DVD's on my Cyberhome recorder. In the past, I've used Ritek, Imation and TDK blank disks with no problems. I've now used about 30 of this stack of 100 Memorex DVD's. Two could not be formatted by the Cyberhome recorder and had to be trashed. Two others recorded, seemed okay, but then could not be finalized, which means I can play them on the Cyberhome but never play them on a PC and who knows what else. That's more than a 10% failure rate. Overall, with the price for these being so reasonable, I'm using the Memorex to record things that if I have finalization problems, I won't be too upset, and using other brands for more important recordings - - but I certainly won't buy them again."
2,"Wringer is a book that you just can't stop reading it keeps pulling you back in to reading it! I loved the book wringer because it showed how some kids go through tough desicions such as having everyone depending on you to do smoething that you don't want to do. In the book Palmer just didn't want to be a wringer at Pigon Day. But, everyone such as his Mom ,Dad, Mutto, Henery, and beans all depended on him. He has a tough chocie to decide. (Defenation of Wringer:When men go out and shoot pigeons on pigeon day in an open feild, a wringer then goes out and catchs the pigeon and wring it neck) To compare to another book I had read would be Holes. I had relized when I was reading Wringer that Wringer is a more sophisitcated book then Holes. I had enjoyed Wringer a lot and hope to read it again!"
1,"As other reviewers have stated, this is a good book for a broad, superficial review, however, the cognitive, experimental, and diagnostic sections are not sufficient prep for the GRE exam - they are too basic and brisk and do not reflect what is actually on the exam. I got a 730, but I did so by looking at the Kaplan book (despite its mistakes galore) but most importantly reviewing my old textbooks. It's a challenging exam, but with good preparation you can beat it. Good luck!"
2,"This book was very good: centering on Muslim dress, it branches off into politics, religion, personal style and globalizing fashion. It covers some of the difficulties Muslim women encounter when wearing hijab. The author does a great job of showing just how complex this topic really is. This book is also fun - I loved seeing all the varieties of dress Muslim women wear. I believe the book breaks down the stereotypical image of a Muslim woman in black from head to toe."
1,"This product is almost 30% sugar! (18 grams out of 63 grams in the single-serve box) That's a greater sugar content than in ice cream or pecan pie, and much more than in Frosted Mini-Wheats. It's over four teaspoons of sugar. This single small box has 240 calories. Be careful with fat-free or low-fat products---they are often high in sugar and calories."
2,"Pam Grier is super bad as Foxy Brown. She is smart, dangerous and incredibly sexy as she battles evil. Like the bad guys, you too will fall under her spell. Classic 70s camp; cool cars, funky tunes, and lots of attitude."
2,Over the last 12 months this book has slowly creapt up my favorites list and now is with out a doubt my favorite Cristian insperational book. It is short and is not complex yet in it's few pages Brother Lawrance brings us a glimpse into the very heart of God. And just like Christianity in general the words of this book are very easy to understand but dificult to apply.
1,"I saw this as part of the longer Cremaster works, at a film festival, so I can't comment on the quality of the DVD. If you know Matthew Barney, you'll probably be interested in something more collectable. If you don't, well, let's just say ""In The Realm Of The Senses"" had a lot more going for it, and although that's not a movie I particularly like it's one I can respect. Barney doesn't make movies, he makes 'high' art. Nothing wrong with that, just nothing particularly appealing about his flavor of it."
1,"I bought this tricycle for my son, who is almost three. He loves it, but it is a hazard for him to ride. The front wheel is not attached securely, and the plastic part that holds it together is either defective or poorly designed. I am writing a letter to the company complaining. Also, the plastic white part of the front wheel falls off whenever we hit a small bump in the sidewalk. If the price seems too good to be true, it really is-- save your money for better quality."
2,"This is one of my favorite series of this genre. It is easily up there with Salvatore as an example of how fun and entertaining this pulp fantasy can be. This work, more than much of the toilet paper printed by other gaming worlds, is nuanced and original. I wish there was more out there like this to read on a sunny beach or a dark corner."
2,Love this space saving shoe holder. Item arrived exactly as described. I added two screws on the bottom of the reinforced edge to secure bottom of organizer to the door to prevent swaying.
2,"This movie, a stunningly bizarre and totally original comedy, has yet to grow old with me, my family, and my friends. The sheer genius the Coen brothers posess shines brilliantly in this well-acted, well-written offbeat comedy.Nick Cage, in an early role, shows us his comedic side, with some truly unforgettable faces, such as the one he shows us when he gets slapped by Ed in the car.Holly Hunter is equally good as the distraught housewife unable to have a baby of her own, so she begs H.I. to steal one for her. What follows is an incredibly fast-paced caper that will leave you laughing and repeating lines (""Son, you've got a panty on yor head!"") for some time to come."
1,"After much research I bought this bedrail for our 2 1/2-year-old. I was very disappointed. I purchased this model because it seemed to be the only one that didn't have bulky rails under the mattress that would ruin the mattress and box springs. The product is very misleading in that respect. It has even bulkier rails than other models that fit 4-5 inches under the mattress (and they have sharp points that will tear holes in the box springs in no time), then the strap, then these worthless L-shaped bars on the other side that always turn sideways. Forget about trying to make the bed. An everyday chore has become an everyday nightmare. The rail is much harder to fold down than other models and those dang L-shaped things always come off every time you tuck the sheet. I haven't tried the foldaway thing, but it's not really a feature I need. I just want to make the bed. I purchased mine for $30 from Target, but still didn't get a good buy for my money."
2,This book is great just like the first one once you read the first you are sure to want to know whats going to happen next..
1,"DO NOT GET THE GAME! Our family just got a PS2 for Christmas this year and i was all excited. I have a Nintendo 64 and have really loved the Zelda games so i was looking for a RPG that would be like it. I saw Dark Cloud and immediatly thought it would be a Zelda for PS2. I rented it and thought it would be great. Gosh was I wrong! Yes, i love the effects...but the game was boring! After 10 min, i was sooo bored that i was ready to return it. Maybe it's great later on....but it's just not what I was looking for in a RPG"
1,"Mariah Carey's final album for Sony is one of the worst records ever made. Every song is pure crap. Her cover of Phil Collins' Against All Odds was God-awful(it was as bad as Mariah's desecration of Def Leppard's Bringing on the Heartbreak and that Barbie looking Aussie kangaroo Kylie Minogue's version of The Locomotion). Heartbreaker(which featured Jay-Z aka Mr. Beyonde Owls) and Crybaby are pure garbage. Every song here is a classic example of pure crap. Buy any CD by Portishead, whose singer Beth Gibbons would outsing Shrieky anyday and has an incredible vocal range. Avoid this awful rainbow and buy the only Rainbow that matters and that is Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow's Rising which is a real musical pot of gold, that's for sure!"
1,"I love these guys, one of my favourite groups of all time, but this cd is for hardcore fans only. Please don't let this be the first time your kids or grandkids hear these guys. I saw them in concert two years ago, and they were great, but my wife and I both commented on how weak their voices and harmonies were getting. Seeing them live and being wrapped up in the concert atmosphere it was fun, but listening to this cd would be painful for anyone who doesn't love them.At first I rated this cd OK, but I had to change it to two stars because I would not want to mislead anyone into purchasing it. There are great albums out there. CSN and DejaVu are classics. If you want live ""Four Way Street"".The redeeming value for me is hear Suite Judy Blue Eyes, when we saw them in concert we couldn't believe it when they didn't do it.CSN and CSN&Y; will be part of my music collection forever, I just probably won't play this one when anyone else is around."
2,"This book spoke to me. It was a book that I read with a pencil so I could underline quotes as I went. I didn't think anyone else could know exactly what I was feeling. I have strived my whole life for success and recognition, but when you're a SAHM, there's no one to pat you on the back and say, ""That was a very good nursing session. I think you're in line for a promotion."" It is culture shock to suddenly define success as, ""I got the floor mopped during nap time."" How refreshing it was to have these feelings (that no mommy would ever want to admit to having) validated. Marriage and parenthood aren't the total bliss of girlhood fantasies -- it's different than you pictured it. If you've ever had those tinges of ""Do I really exist as a human anymore, or am I just an extention of my offspring,"" then you need to read this book."
2,"If you are not a technical golfer, then I highly recommend this book to you. Very simple and unlike some other reviews; I found it a great read. I've read it twice now, and will probably read it again when I'm on vacation this summer."
2,"If you can only have one book on animal health, this is it. Keep one in the stable and one on the night stand. Sage wisdom as found in this inclusive book is sadly getting harder to find as the years pass.End of story."
2,"I'm using this bag when I want to travel really light.Several configurations:1. Body + Small zoom + primeD80 + 17-50mm + 50f1.82. Body + Small zoom + speedlightD80 + 17-50mm + SB600 (Tighter fit but it works well).If you've ever used an older Domke, you'll know how difficult the metal clips are to open. On this model, however, the clip on the shoulder strap is really easy to open. I hope Domke implements it on more models."
1,"This book was a complete waste of time and money for me. Poorly organized and cross referenced. For the novice, such as myself, it provided no explanation as to the types of marks to identify the makers. It did not display any marks either. There are no color photos, and what photos are found are dark and useless. I was very unhappy with this purchase."
2,"JUST A FUN LITTLE MOVIE WITH A GOOD CAST THAT THE WHOLE FAMILY CAN SIT DOWN AND ENJOY. IF YOU ENJOYED ""POLICE SQUAD"" AND THE 'NAKED GUN' COPS-AND-ROBBERS PARODIES YOU WILL ENJOY THIS!"
1,"Eureka Hand-Held Vacuum, 71BI bought two of these and they both failed after just a couple hours of total use. The brush stopped spinning on both units and could not be fixed. The switch was very hard too push and sometimes I would push it to far and the dust collection container would fall off spilling dirt and dust all over. They did have good suction, really picked up per hair, when they worked. I bought them based on all the good reviews I read. Oh well, live and learn.I've had other Eureka vacuums that worked great and lasted for years but this one is terrible in my opinion."
1,"After using the Shop-Vac 4040010 Shop Sweep Indoor/Outdoor Vacuum for less than an hour, we noticed that the strap holding the collection bag to the handle had already torn--or come unsewed. Hoping that I might be able to get a new bag, I called Amazon and was told just to return it. I am still in shock. It was a lot of work to assemble it. Now to think about disassembly and repackaging is just too much today!"
2,"Pampers and Huggies are, in our opinion, the best diaper brands out there. We have a slightly preference for Pampers because they look less ""bulky"" on the baby, compared to Huggies or store brands. And it is the best deal I have for diapers, considering the 15% discount from Amazon ""Subscribe & Save"" program. However, I've noticed that the diaper is no longer available as a ""Subscribe & Save"" item, so I am not sure whether I would buy it for the full price - I would have to compared unit costs using my spreadsheet to see if it is worth it."
1,"I was very disappointed when I first played this game. I am a huge fan of Mario Party 1-6, and even got my Gamecube so I could continue getting them. Mario Party Advance is nothing like any of them. The mini games are difficult with the gameboy and there is no real board game where you try to get the star. Those missions are really dumb. For more entertainment, get any of the gameboy Harvest Moons. At least they held my attention for longer than ten minutes."
2,I ordered this book after trying their food in one of their NY locations. The book is great I just wish they would open more locations so I cook pick up their food without having to cook. This place has wonderful food. And the book explains how to make most of their best dishes.
1,"Sorry folks, I agree with David Gates. An interesting idea but sloppy writing with an author in pretentious mode often more interested in showing his own ""intelligence"" than in constructing a fluid or challenging narrative. I felt like joining Vikram and was delighted to finish this book! Only buy it if you are prepared to wade through some pretty turgid stuff."
1,The TV was advertised as new. An obviously used TV with a defective screen arrive. After a lot of hassle I was finally given a return address label. But the refund still hasn't arrived after nearly a month. The problem is mostly Target. Do not buy from Target via Amazon.
1,"I ordered this for my sons crib and it was the WORST mistake I've made!! After the first wash, it started to fray along the edges. After the 2nd wash, all the squares were coming apart and you can't sew them back because it would not look right. The little strings that hold the bumpers to the crib are horrible... some ripped completly off so that section of the bumper does not stay on the crib. I have had the set for 9 months now and i will be replacing it today. It is completely horrible. Looks nice but the quality of it is minus 10. For the price I paid for it, I expected tons more out of it. I could have gone to the dollar store and probably found something that worked better, that's how cheap this set is!!!! VERY DISAPPOINTED, do not buy and save your self the money!!"
2,I am very pleased with these straws. These are my Milkshake straws. I like making shakes using Chocolate chip mint icecream and these straws do not ever get plugged up by the chips. They are also easy to rinse out and reuse.
2,"In this hip, creepy and addictively readable novel, Dierbeck riffs on 'Alice in Wonderland,' exploring the pedophiliac obsession that underpinned that great classic. Think about it: Carroll wrote his 'Alice' in an attempt to woo a tiny girl into his lap; it is a child molestor's love song.In this book, Dierbeck gives Alice her voice. To do that, she teleports her 11-year-old to 1970s New York and sends her spinning through the art world and the drug underground.This book brilliantly asks the big, tough questions about art. If one of the greatest books in the Western canon was motiviated by pedophelic desire, then what should be our relationship to it be? Or more bluntly, what happens when great art is created by terrible people?"
2,"Este libro es muy ameno. Te llama a la oración que nace, no de un sentido de deber, sino de amor y gratitud. No es otro manual sobre cómo cumplir con una obligación religiosa, sino un llamado a intimar con el Creador del universo. No te sentirás culpable de tener una vida de oración pobre, sino que te sentirás inspirado a profundizar más en tu relación con Dios. Y te ayuda a crecer en la Palabra también, pues su exégesis es sana.El Dr. Cornwall ha escrito más de 50 libros de gran relevancia para el cuerpo de Cristo. Te aseguro que disfrutarás éste."
2,"While this album veers a little away from the jazz genre, it is full of beautiful melodies and great interplay between Metheny and Frisell. Not to mention a solid supporting cast. It is not often that a meeting of two legends comes out as good as you would expect it, but this one hits the mark. Highly recommended for any music lover."
2,"I bought this book because it is required for my daughter's honors history class this coming school year. I have been reading parts of it myself. It is a heavy read, especially for those who do not like modern era history and/or are lacking in a fairly good background in history and world politics. For those that want great historical and world political analysis that has great insight into today's policical environment, this book gives a wealth of information and analysis which is well-written, with occasional sprinkles of humor and irony."
1,"Very powerful little handheld, great for stairs and hard to reach spots. Clearly would be a 5 star itemEXCEPT...We only used the thing every few months on our stairs and a couple other tight spots. Couldn't have had more than an hour or two of run time on the machine. The first time we used it after the end of the one year warranty, the motor let out all it's black smoke. It even left a stain on the carpet. I really expect products to last a bit longer than their warranty."
2,I enjoy the way the A Teens take the great music of the original ABBA and put it to new modern dance beats
1,It is cumbersome to installI am using one of the other spindlesI am moving 45 records to my computer
2,"This cd is sooo nice...the first cut ""Put me On"" is my favorite. It sounds like funk w/ a hint of jazz. I love his style of music, even his Luther remake of ""Superstar"" is done in excellent taste."
1,"Somewhat enjoyable read with phantasmic beasts that pine to commit sodomy on witless victims. Really, in all honesty, the one star rating mirrors the tremendously ill, high cost the sellers are asking for imbibing this made up horror. A curse and a byword on those greedy beast sellers!!!! Be not the next fool to pay such a high price. Hearken to the stingy voice within."
2,I found I had to have two of these for my bannister dimensions. Also nice for eliminating the holes in your wood or easy removal for dressing up the house. Excellent quality and rugged.
1,"I did not like this movie at all. After All About you became one of my favorite movies, I figured that I could not go wrong with All About Us. I was so wrong. You can not judge this movie by its cover. If this film maker is going to come out with more All About movies, he have to come much stronger then this. I was very disappointed with this one."
2,"I love this bag holder, very convenient on walks to pick up my dogs presents. The bags are a little bit thin, you can see the poo through them - which I thought they would be dark enough to hide it."
2,Awesome price and totally worth it. This is a fantastic stand and very well designed. I might actually buy another one.
1,Sorry if I'm a negative voice but these hdmi cables were garbage. I've always had pleasant shopping experience on Amazon and this is the first purchase of many that I had to write negatively about. Maybe it was just a bad cable.
2,I purchased this product to replace my broken pump from my Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain. Someone else had said that it would work and it was half the price. I figured with the easy return policy on Amazon Prime items I would try it. I just got it today and it was awesome. It is a perfect replacement. The picture of the product shows the tube sticking up but it is not attached when you get it. It is a removable piece. I didn't attach it and the male part of the fountain fit perfectly in the pump and it is working great. So glad I bought this and not the $20 replacement pump from the vendor. Plus with Prime I got it in 2 days.
1,"I hate this bra. I have no idea what purpose the hooks serve. It goes on over your head. Look closely at the picture of the back, read the reviews ... I wish I had. I have several slightly similar Champion bras from several years back that I loved so much - they had great control, and although I bought them for exercise, I started wearing them all the time. Champion sadly no longer makes them, but I thought this bra looked very similar to them and probably had similar ""engineering,"" but I was mistaken. The strangest thing is, for all its massive structure in the back (which you can't get to to try to adjust without doing some straitjacket-like contortions), the support is minimal. Can't express how disappointed I am in this product."
2,I love my poster. It's so nifty and has so much detail. People will always ask about it.
1,"thought this was a stand alone book with additional books as seperate stories... wrong. unless you read the entire series, reading only this book is like reading only one book in the LoTR trilogy (which had the decency to describe itself as a trilogy). I hate being lured in by authors who string readers along book after book just to gain additional sales. This book was neither exceptionally well written nor interesting. I won't be reading the others for principle as well as lack of interest"
2,"First time I've tried line drying my clothes. The effort was for energy savings. I just didn't want anything large or obtrusive in my yard so these were perfect. Now that we have used them for several weeks, we love them. Great product...easy to install and take down when not in use. Great value for low cost & no shipping."
2,"Exxon Mobil, Haliburton, Dick Cheney et. al., still destroying America. Recently, 3 major university studies attempting to prove fracking was not harmful have been discredited. This film fulfills it's main purpose in all respects, primarily raising awareness to the dangers to human life, animal life and the planet due to fracking. And, it's all about money. Excellent film exposing the failure of departments of environmental quality and even some congressmen. So, what's new? I saw it, now I'll buy it and make sure all my grandkids see it."
2,"Had the pan for several weeks and we are very pleased with its style, performance, and build."
2,"This has always been one of my favorite comedies since I was young..I would recommend to everyone, especially those with children."
1,"This is one of the best books I've read on the subject. Everyone who is involved in any type of business research or competitor research can benefit from this book. It even includes detailed descriptions of some of the best business information resources available, on- and offline."
1,"At the time this item was ordered by me, the description indicated it was a closeout 10-pack for $1.99. I ordered a quantity of 10 (my thinking: 100 rolls). Received 10 rolls for $19.90 plus shipping making this tape work out to over $3.50 a roll. Go to Wal-Mart and buy tape for $0.47 per roll!"
1,"This is an excellent film, which unfortunately has not been given a decent treatment by the distributor. I was very disapointed in the quality of the release- the picture quality is poor, inter-titles appear to be missing, and the score which has been added is just a repetition of long synth chords that don't match the action on-screen. It's a shame, because a film like this one deserves much better."
2,"I use it for fried foods as well as straining my homemade pretzels from their soda bath. Easy cleanup, too. Glad I bought this."
1,"""Nine Lives"" is a very poor film from every single artistic angle; from its direction? has-been actors, dialogue (trite) and repetition---my short version---not worth the money at any price. Sorry guys (and gal) and, yes, I am a fan of Larry Kramer...but...."
2,"This is a superb dark comedy with a terrific script, cast, and directing. Jack Black stepped out of his usual role and nailed it as ""Bernie."" Shirley MacLaine also showed serious talent in this movie, and I can't remember the last time I saw her in a movie! Highly recommended!"
1,"I read all 4 books in this series. It was interesting, but there was too much repetition throughout each book and each subsequent book gave repeated extended history from the previous books, which was really unnecessary. All 4 books could have been written as 1 book which would havce saved all the repetitious history. If reading the books one after the other as I did, it made for quite a boring book. I skipped quite a bit in the final 2 books. I can understand why the publisher discontinued this book. Well-written, but disappointing."
1,"After using this thing for at least a year, I am getting ready to remove it and throw it away. It simply won't open cans. It is very hard to get it started, and once started even harder to keep it going to completely cut the lid. Also, cans with lots of liquid in them will have juices strewn everywhere while it attempts to cut the lids. What a mess! I had an old GE Spacemaker years ago that worked like a dream, but this ""Spacemaker"" is no relative or close kin. It was extremely frustrating at Thanksgiving trying to open many cans. I'll be going back to a regular countertop model, unfortunately, before Christmas."
1,"I wasn't expecting much, just something to exercise my legs on without taking too much space in my little apartment. The tention does not go up NEARLY enough to make this useful at all, I might as well be peddling my legs the air! Just laughably bad, don't waste your time or money."
2,"When i first started out with this game i thought it was going to suck but the more i played it the more addicted i got! it's has some awesome kill's. A great story line and of course a lethal amount of Punish ment! This game is deff a 5 star game, And you can buy it on here for less than ten dollars. Well worth the price of admission."
2,"This is it. Period. I doubt there'll ever be a Ring like this again. Genuine Wagner singers at work, Birgit Nilsson has a voice with a vengeance, Windgassen is great and Hans Hotter may well have been the best Wotan ever. The Vienna Philharmonic is the Vienna Philharmonic, that says it all. Just put on your headphones or turn up the speaker and go back to the glory days of Wagner performance. Never a dull moment with Solti."
1,"The worst printer I've every had, by far. Painfully slow. Jams constantly. Very noisy. Every time you bring your PC out of sleep mode, it pops up an annoying Status window indicating the printer is online, also pops this up randomly at times. I will go back to Epson next time."
1,"I found this book to be quite boring. The characters held no charm or interest for me. The way each section came from another character's point of view added nothing and made it seem like a rehashing of scenes over and over again. I kept with it hoping to be rewarded with a revelation or two by the end, but sadly that was not the case. Very disappointing."
2,"Another great little text by Boynton. As usual her witty prose and simple but engaging illustrations are a delight to read and my children always enjoy.One small annoyance, the book shows animals exercising right before bedtime. After reading my children want to do exercise activity and this gets them a little wound up making bed time a bit extra challenging. My solution is to read that book first, then read another more sedate themed book to help the children settle down again."
1,"I had no problem with the seller, the product came in good condition without any visable defects.The problem is that the battery didn't work upon arrival, after I replaced the battery (it is not one intended for replacement and I tinker in electronics a bit), The headset work as intended.Because of the nature of the headset the battery is very hard to replace and not intended to be replaced by the average user. So while the product worked as intended after a battery replacement, many customers may get a headset that dosen't work because of this problem."
1,"Dont get me wrong, I LOVE horror, suspense, splatterpunk, erotica, if its wierd I love it! But this was trash, never have I read anything so slow and dpressing, the story is about this loser of a guy, who trips and bust open his head, suffering brain damage, he then whines and cries about it, and then finds a buddy who drives him around the country so he can whine and moan while traveling. boo!"
1,"I did not receive the dart board which was to be a birthday gift. I wasn't even notified. Tried to track it myself and then called, only to be told it was undeliverable. WHAT!"
1,"Not sure if it was the seller or manufacturer fault, but this product was so defective it's not even funny. Not to mention the fact it arrived days late. Returned it today."
1,I purchased this product because the first one burned out within a few months of buying the system. I will need to wait and see how long this one will last. The system came with 2 modules. the other is still working fine
1,"UNDER-achieving is back in vogue with this PRETENTIOUS - HYPED mess of an album! It is nothing close to the Bends or OK Computer - The songs (dare I call them that) have no structure. I have seen people say thats the beauty of it - Hogwash! If that were the case then nobody would even know about them, If it wasnt for albums like the Bends and Ok, then they wouldnt be in this self-absorbing position, because no-one would care. The song Optomistic is grand though too bad about the rest."
2,"I have mild acne, and i usually get my acne for about a week once a month. A few of my friends told me how great the ClearWave was, so i decided to give it a trial. I started using it a few days before my breakouts usually pop up and I have noticed that the amount of pimples and blemishes i get during that time is reduced, to almost none on my face. I enjoy this product, and like that i don't have to use harsh chemicals on my face everyday."
1,"Absolutely terrible! The story was weak, the acting weak and I've seen better camera work in wedding videos. Don't waste your money or worse, your time."
1,"Dear Friends, WE have read this book, and other reviews, and WE have made a conclusion for myself. This book is a visionary, it leaves you open mouthed and sleeping (drooling too.)... although it seems to contain good topics such as friendship and love in the book, it is SO scrambled that the book turns into a jumbling piece of literature. The book contains random events that have nothing to do with each other, yet somehow Barbara Kingsolver uses extremely bad writing and a strong Tucson accent to tie all the events together. All in all, WE,Roger Ling, RAymond Gao, and Jonathan Bau appreciate the hard effort that Kingsolver put into this ""interestingly unique"" book, but next time she wants to write another book alike this one, we shall say, ""Thanks, but no thanks. Think of the future generations."" P.S. WE were unable to finish the book due to the book's lack of quality."
1,"If you're wondering why this CD is so cheap, the answer is that it is rubbish!! These tracks are not from the orginal recordings produced by Vangelis himself. They are played by what sounds like an untalented 10 year old plinking out the tunes on a cheap keyboard. The result is so bad that the CD doesn't deserve to bare Vangelis' name! This CD is an utter insult to one of the most brilliant composers of all time and should be avoided at all costs!!"
2,"I rated this 4 out of 5 stars only because once I ran through the video with Jillian's verbal instruction I wish I could now just skip the verbal and go through the circuits without all that. There's a lot of (necessary for the beginner) talking which makes these circuits go slow. I just hit the FF button on my remote now - next circuit! Jillian is great! The cardio is great too, gets your heart pumping. The moves are not difficult and can be modified if needed. I definitely recommend this item!"
1,This is the sleeziest and poorly produced film I have ever seen. It is vulgar and done in very poor taste. Only the scum of the world find any entertainment in ths dvd.
2,"Well, who is she????? Well, during the listen, I guessed Billie Holliday but then Doris Day kept piping in. i could not tell which singer it was, and low and behold it was a combo of the two in the persona of Mis Madeleine. Dont buy this for any thing but easy listening. It is the perfect background dinner music or for a middle age seduction, If you put it in the car for listening on a drive you will fall asleep, Her perfect Ella Fitzgerald voice is slow and easy. It is a wonderful listen, great for a rainy lazy afternoon in the hammock."
1,"This book is painful to read. Ending up skipping many paragraphs that were the author totally overanalyzing his swing or own mental state, as I wanted to finish the book figuring it would be fun to learn about the mini-tours -- golf's single-A leagues. Learned a little, but most of the book is the author self-flaggelating blather about his mental state, or lack thereof. Was hoping to hear about the background and dreams of the various cast of characters on the tours -- there might be five pages of that in a 300-page sleep-aid. Spends a full page explaining how his choice of socks ruined his round. This book is incorrectly titled. It should be ""Fine Green Gap: The Pipe Dreams of a Three-Handicap and How He Got to Write a Book About It."""
1,"I bought TH-42PZ700U in 2008. Got the ""Seven Blinking Lights of Death"" in August 2011. The TV was fabulous while it lasted. . . but did not last nearly as long as it should have for the cost. The picture was great, but my favorite part was the side firing speakers that no one seems to do anymore. They all want to sell you surround systems to make up for the poorly designed bottom speakers found in most sets today. Now onto the dillema of repair or replace. . ."
2,"A hori hori is the best digging tool you can use, much more so than a trowel. Among hori hori, this is the best one I have used. It is very sharp and its long blade gives you more leverage and greater reach into the soil. This is an excellent tool for planting and weeding. I have also used the A. M. Leonard soil knife, which is essentially a hori hori, and though that is a great tool, this one is better."
1,"Nice little flashlight and well crafted but, why in the heck does it need its very own specially sized ""AAAA"" battery? At first, I thought it was a mis-print on battery size. Streamlight should be ashamed of them selves. A person could really find themselves out of luck if the battery runs-out and nobody ""in-town or other country"" has never even heard of 4A size, worthless batteries. At the end of the day folks, no power means, no work. The engineers of StreramLight would be truly ""reaching"" to justify thier choice of batteries when ""AA"" or even ""AAA"" would work so much better and more efficiently."
2,"You will be able to play this game for 20 - 30 minutes at a time as it will get boring-kind of.But it is pretty cool.You can create Barbie's clothes,dance-moves and concert."
2,"Me encanta esta obra y la re orquestacion de Mozart es muy interesante de escuchar y esta version hace justicia a la calidad de la musica, todos los interpretes estan brillantes, es una de esas grabaciones que no me canso de escuchar y tiene una magia especial"
1,Christopher Caliendo's score is very weak. Why he was chosen or why the original score was replaced is a mystery. This score is perfunctory at best. It does not work in this film at all.
1,I hate to even waste my time writing a review for this junk! But if a save one person from seeing this film it was all worth while. It's too bad they could have made this film alot better but it's to late. It's not worth the 3.00 to rent it and DON'T even think about buying it!! OK I'm done bi***ing now!
1,"When I got the camera, I immediately noticed the small size. That along with the CCD were pluses, but as soon as I turned on the camera for recording, that's when the problems started. First of all, please, somebody tell me if this is correct or if I should return it for an exchange (mine may be faulty):The winding noise from the DV tape is captured onto all films recorded. This means that there is a constant train like noise captured onto all of the videos I record from this camcorder. I'm thinking that the manufacturer's can't be that stupid to make such a faulty mistake, so I'm gonna try to exchange this for another one. Is there any hope in doing this, or does all JVC GR-D230's have this problem?I also didn't like the need to install their proprietary software.Please, people who have this camera, tell me if this is a common mistake that you have to live with, or is this just a faulty item they shipped. Thanks"
1,After some research I purchased this model several months ago. Though quite content with it initially it ultimately disappointed me. The heating element/hot plate became horribly corroded. And the small black tab that secured the top on the grinder receptacle snapped off. It's not a bad price... but I'd suggest you keep your receipt!
1,"Flimsy and difficult to install. You need a Hacksaw and forget about installing this yourself, must have someone to hold it while you are installing so the pipes dont bend. This should have been in the 20 range for the quality."
1,"Product wasn't what I expected. Material was flimsy, difficult to blow up. Would not buy another one. Wasn't happy with product."
2,"Heard BLACK AND BLUE by Anna Quindlen, a grippingnovel about a woman whose passionate marriage became anightmare . . . the main character, Fran Benedetto, then decidedto run away with her son and start a new life . . . I found myselfreally caring for Fran, and that to me is what fine writing is allabout . . . if you read or listen to this book, make sure youhave tissues with you when you do; the ending will isvirtually heartbreaking . . . adding to my enjoyment wasLili Taylor's outstanding job of narration . . . it was perhapsthe finest I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing."
2,It is what it looks like. A big truck with a moveable backhoe and front loader. It's light weight and is plastic so it doesnt have any metal corners to worry about. My 2 year old brings it to bed.
2,"I'm pleased with this clock radio. It's size is nice, small enough to travel with. The sound quality is quite good; although I'm no expert, I know what I like."
2,"My tracfone has worked out good so far. Customer service is fine and the free voicemail was easy to set up and use. If you decide to get a tracfone, please email me for a quick referral before activating it- we each will get 120 free minutes from the 'refer a friend' program. I'll also send you the simple instructions to follow. I've used Tracfone for quite a while, so i should be able to answer any questions you might have.ps even if you have activated in the last few weeks i should be able to get us the free minutes."
2,"I bought this playset for my niece's birthday and she loves it. This set comes with not only the baby Pegasus but also 2 adult ponies and 1 baby pony. This would be a great starter set for because of the extra ponies and the amount of accessories this set comes with. The hula skirt, snorkel and fins will fit on both the baby ponies and the adult ponies. The playset is also easy to put together and the tropical tune it plays is really pleasant. This is a large playset so it has lots of things for the ponies to do and lots of room to play with multiple ponies. If the child likes ponies and the beach this is the perfect playset to buy."
2,"I bought this for my pirate- and puzzle-loving son. The pieces are very high quality and I feel that it will last a long time without any of the little tabs breaking off (which often happens with lower quality puzzles.) It is obviously a wonderful pirate picture, too."
1,The handle on this is very unbalanced and difficult to hold. I think it would only be good for men with very large hands. I am a woman and I do have larger hands.The flip top spout used for putting the soap in will snag and open when you try to clean your drinking glasses.The sponge is way to big if you ever had a Libby version then its 2 times the size of those it may sound nice to have a larger sponge but it again makes it harder to manuver and very awkward.This also does not wash dishes very well as a sponge because its covered with a scrubby material. If you need to simply scrub your dishes its better to just get a good dish brush by OXO and they have better ratings.I am back to using my regular dish sponge for now.
1,"The hook to this book is incredible. I read the first few pages and knew I needed to read the rest. The crimes are interesting at first. Unfortunately, the book as a whole is not good. The writing, especially the dialogue, is overdone. The insane brother is unnecessary and annoying. Most of the plot is taken up by the protagonist melodramatically caring for his alcoholic ladyfriend, rather than doing any actual sleuthing.Thriller isn't my favorite genre, so maybe those who have a soft spot for thrillers will enjoy this more than I did. I've definitely read thrillers worse than this one, I would chose this over a lot of Patterson's books, for example. And I think Kerley has promise, given that this was his first novel. Some thoughtful editing would've gone a long way to tone down the excessive drama and help Kerley's ideas shine."
2,"Ótimo livro. Merece ser lido. É um livro abrangente, pois aborda fatos históricos acontecidos com o protagonista, deixando de somente preocupar-se com os fatos atuais. Mostra claramente o emaranhado do poder existente no Capitol e também na Casa Branca. Desconsidera qualquer tipo de importncia latente, atual ou mesmo futura, da América Latina. Resume a abordar tendncias estratégicas dos EUA e potenciais interesses nas áreas críticas do mundo atual. Recomendo a leitura."
2,"This is great for smooth jazz fans, especially saxaphone enthusiast. Kirk Whalum has been in the biz a while now but as one of his earlier efforts this shines."
1,"unfortunately the DVD was for America and since I am in Australia, it would not play here. Soo disappointed !"
1,"I'm so glad I bought this used for $2 vs. new. It looks cool, and the Kitchenaid brand was a plus. Muffins and cupcakes don't brown like they should. The texture and crumb are different. The pan doesn't effect taste luckily. Storage is a problem. Using non-stick sprays leaves a sticky finish to the muffin pan eventually that does not come off in the dishwasher - which would also happen with some metal cupcake or cake pans as well. I do not recommend this at all. If anyone wants to pay shipping, they can have my pan! I'll stick to metal pans."
1,this show should be canceled. it's horrible and annoying. The show just seems so scripted. The drama is mediocre at best.
1,"The lighting, editing, and camera work for this video is poor. Regardless, I watch live performances for the music. The sound recording was good, but I have mixed opinions about the performance. Mic was GREAT. Lindsey and Stevie were also great, but Christie was unemotional -- kinda like a non-chalet reporter. John was okay, but let's face it -- he's not much of a bass player."
1,"This is a reel to reel 16 mm silent movie filmed during ""Help"" shootings by a crew member (maybe an opeator or is wife, I dunno). The movie is really short (16 minutes) and shows little Beatles action. It's a die hard collector item (I own the VHS version)."
1,"I am a Greene fan but this story simply dragged when it needed to have some emotional drive. By the end, I cared neither for Henry or Blistex, and had long forgotten Sarah. Greene seems to have had a kernel of a story without an idea of an ending or what the ultimate message was."
1,"I was biking across Third Avenue on 49th street in Manhattan when I spotted Ken Jennings on the North-West corner of the street. I recognized him immistakeably and was inclined to yell ""Ken!"" at him as I raced by. At first he didn't turn but when I was fifteen feet past him he turned and looked and gave me a sort of sheepish look, like ""yes, it's me alright."" It'll go down as one of my favorite celebrity sightings even though I recently lost all respect for him when I played this new board game called ""Can You Beat Ken?"" not licenced by Jeopardy. It plays roughly like Trivial Persuit but the questions are so poorly written it seems like the question writers just copied a bunch of text off Wikipedia and added some question marks here and there. Luckily it came with some miniature Ken Jennings-shaped playing pieces which I promptly desecrated with a permenant marker when the game became too frustrating to play."
2,"It will be the bset the game based in Mamia,flordia. There will be alot more missions for you to complete. There will be better audio,graphics,cars. Also now you can steal motorcycles and Airplanes and Helocopters"
1,"If you are looking for a good recipe book for raw food, this is probably not it. Author spends way too much time story-telling than providing worth while claims backed by evidence. However, if you are a complete novice to the world of good nutrition it may be an interesting start. Overall this book contains information poor content which if pooled together might add up to an interesting essay. Flip through it at Borders before buying!!"
1,"I concur with the other mediocre reviews - this one felt like the author's editor went on vacation and didn't finish her job. Aside from the broad problems of plot (or lack thereof), character development and dialogue (I read to avoid having mundane conversations with significant others, I don't want to have to read them in my books), the author has an annoying habit of heavy-handedly foreshadowing future events. I LOVED her first book, but this one felt like a rush job for a looming deadline. Skip it."
2,"The novel The Wandering Taoist is a true story by Deng Ming Dao that takes place in China at a time when their were martial art families or clans one would be born into as a child. You as the reader will follow along with the Wandering Taoist as goes from a young average human to the ellightened being he is today. I really enjoyed this book, not only because it was well written but because you actually feel as if you have gotten something out of reading this book. You will be more in touch with yourself."
1,"He starts with: Before you Start. And tells us: If you don't like the book, then please do not feel compelled to share that with me. ""I do not care."" ""I am not interested in your criticism or your ideas or your feedback.""Then on page 3, he tells us: ""Listen to your customers.""Why would anyone want to read a book giving the unwashed masses advice that doesn't apply to the Jackass behind the typewriter?You can do better than this. Go on to the next author. Give this guy a pass. He doesn't deserve your hard earned dollars."
2,"Taylor's book represents a monumental achievement. This is a tremendous book that covers the history of Blacks in the West more completely and with greater detail than any previous work. It easily supplants William Katz's ""The Black West"" and W. Sherman Savage's ""Blacks in the West"" as the definitive work in the field. This book should be required reading for every student in American history."
2,"Amazing music. exellent explanations, not too long just in time.The singing , the druming , the words remind us where the real beating of the heart is coming from."
2,"I wish they would bring this back into print along with the rest of the ""Shoes"" books by Noel Streetfield. They are wholesome books that need no censorship and are about children and families overcoming adversity."
2,I think this changing table is fantastic for the price. It's sturdy and the color of wood is really nice. I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because the changing pad is really too thin to be comfortable and some of the bars were damaged in shipment. I would recomend this table to anyone interested.
1,"Is ""industrial"" code for ""won't even stick to itself""? I couldn't believe when I opened the package how ridiculously useless this product was. I bought it for attaching guitar pedals to a pedal board, and I wouldn't trust this to even stick to itself, let alone hold anything of minimal weight.Seriously disappointed in the marketing scam this product is. I wanted something to replace the cheap velcro my pedal train board came with, and this stuff makes the pedaltrain velcro look amazing (and that stuff is pretty bad)I would give this negative stars if I could"
2,My daughter received this book as a Christmas gift and loves it. She was only a year old at the time and loved touch and feel books. She still loves it now at 15 months. I enjoy reading it to her. Sandra Boynton's books are fabulous.
1,Beautiful picture but if your looking for a how-to book save your money. I bought all three and it's not what I needed. If you want to go up that next step in modeling look elsewhere.
1,"I received this same horn as a gift 8 years before my recent order. The original horn sounded like a bull, and was always entertaining when people and animals always responded to the horn. Cows would come to the fence to see where the bull was.The current horn sounds like the bull was neutered, and is not happy about it. I returned the first one, and the second one sounded the same. So I put it on my truck and though it must need to break in. I was wrong. after 3 months it still sucks.I contacted Wolo and they said if the 1st and 2nd sound the same, they are correct. How is that useful? Amazon wont take it back, so I'm stuck.I'll try to adjust the horn (voiding any warranty?), if not, I'm removing the horn and throwing it away.Don't buy this horn! It sounds bad, not like bull."
2,Great easy to understand documentary on the global financial crisis. Matt Damon was a great narrator and it is an easy to follow idiots guide on how it started and what eventuated and what was promised and just have never been acted on. Highly recommended.
2,"The antenna works great. I bought it for my USB Internet Access card. The aircard barely has a useable signal inside the house with only it's built in antenna. The antenna has a ten foot cable which lets it sit at the corner of the front porch. I have a steady 3 or 4 bar signal most of the time with the antenna.The only complaint is that nearly every cellular device; aircards and phones, need a unique adapter cable to work with the antenna. This is not the fault of the antenna maker or seller. It is due to a lack of standardization in the cellular industry. This vendor does sell most of the adapter cables for [...] but their info does not make it obvious that you need one or easy to figure out which one.There is an exhaustive list of the adapters, searchable by device manufacturer and model numbers at the antenna makers site at [...]Good Luck"
2,"Forgive, For Good provides valuable advice for those people hanging on to their ""grievance stories."" Learn effective techniques to forgive so you can release the anger taking up space in your mind and begin to fill it with joy."
2,"I was totally unprepared for how wonderful this movie turned out to be. Funny, very clever, exciting, heart-felt, and, in my humble opinion, the best Star Trek movie ever made (even though it was a parody)! It remained perhaps truer to the essence of the old Star Trek TV shows than any of the Star Trek Movies I had seen, and managed at the same time to be a stirring redemption story that had me cheering at the end. A must-see for all Star Trek fans, and a movie that non-Trekkies will really enjoy as well. This is also one of those rare movies for me that I have enjoyed seeing over and over again."
2,"my first copy of ""the tipping point"" disappeared. i don't know if i lost it, or if it got stolen. i JUST BOUGHT another copy this past weekend, and guess what, yup lost again. so this is my third copy, and hopefully its the charm. my point is, yes this cd is that good. i think its extremely strange that it disappeared twice already, but it's a classic in my book, so if i have to buy it another 5 times for it to reach plaque status, i would."
1,I bought this book and returned it as it was far too complicated for the average person. I was after a practical application of option trading not just the theory.
1,"Nowhere in the book, nor on Amazon detailed info nor in the ""view pages inside"" is mentioned that the book treats BW 2.0 and IS NOT GOOD for BW 3.1 or later.I had to read all the buyers reviews and to find out about the BW version, only after I had the book ordered and sent to me. So Because I use 3.2 I have sent back this book. It's not up-to-date, there seems not to be a reprint for BW 3.0So it was not useful to me. I am very disappointed.The book can show you some tasks to do in BW 2.0 but it learns you nothing if you have other cubes to make in different SAP applications.Also, it does not mention the transaction names behind the screens printed. Pitty, since this could have helped us when working in BW 3.0 (screens and menus can change but often the TX's remain the same)..."
1,"There has been much debate over the past ten years of what constitutes poetry. This book involves a broad scope of what is now considered poetry and why very few people ""like"" poetry. To sum it up, ""good grief!"""
2,"Well, the last reviewer CLEARLY showed his lack of knowledge on REM or his good taste. So, where to start?REM had hit their high point twice in the past. The first time was MURMUR, an indie rock classic that was influential to many bands. The second time was their commercial breakthrough, DOCUMENT, when a large amount of confused people turned ""The One I Love"" into a hit. Now, AUTOMATIC FOR THE PEOPLE has become a melancholy classic.Track by track, this is REM's best album lyrically, and it benefits from the reliance on acoustic instruments. ""Drive"", ""Man on the Moon"", ""Everybody Hurts"", ""The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite"" and ""Nightswimming"" are among REM's best songs. ""Try Not To Breathe"", ""Monty Got A Raw Deal"" and ""Find The River"" are probably REM""s best songs that nobody knows about. If you are an REM fan and you don't own this, buy it as soon as possible."
2,"I was really surprised at the quality of sound. They are light and comfortable. After wearing them for a while however, the ears get a bit warm."
1,Here is another attempt to rearrange and invent reality in order to demean and defame an eminently decent and capable President. I cannot imagine what her personal grudge seems to be but it is obvious that it has affected her ability to think clearly. She should stick to writing articles about Texas barbecue or beef because she sure can't get the politics right.
1,"In an ad for this book in the ""Human Events"" she writes: ....liberals are either traitors or idiots ....What an insult to about half the citizens of the USA. Having read a few excerpts I decided not to waste my time on literature like this. Sorry Amazon ...."
1,Sometimes a decent concept just doesn't translate into a good reality. Never has this been shown to be more true than in Neil Diamond's reditions of some great movie tunes. The vocals are mundane and lipid. A very sad disappointment.
2,"Ingrid Michaelson has an amazing voice and is also a terrific songwriter, and both qualities shine through on her first album. I bought it for the Old Navy song (""The Way I Am"") but have found new favorites, especially ""The Hat,"" ""Die Alone,"" and ""Highway."" Beautiful melodies, interesting harmonies, and reflective, poignant lyrics. I was able to see her live, and she sounds just as great as she does on the album, which says a lot during these days of studio magic ""artists""."
2,"Got it, works great, no problems at all. The bass IS way too loud. If you don't love bass, do not get this item. I did turn the volume down all the way and that helps. Grenades and the like sound awesome, the surround works great too, even inside the headphones. Other reviewers who heard a buzzing noise, most likely have grounding issues with their home wiring (lack of third prong). I am extermely sensitive to buzzing noises and my headphones were very clean sounding. All that aside, the wires are like an octpus around your lap, get the wireless version if you can afford it."
2,"Great bibs, not too heavy but absorbent and waterproof. Drool does not wick around to the backside like alot of bibs."
1,This is the first time I am trying Unbox Video. It did not work. The Video Player kept crashing. I have a Pentium M Machine with 1 GB and running Windows XP Media Center Edition with SP2. Very dissapointing.
1,"As his life is most of his book is about anything but football. you will find most of his book telling you how beautifull his wife is and how much each of her dresses cost and how beautifull they are.Sir Alex was right to kick him out of the club, he is nothing but a spoiled brat.It was total waste of time, Don't waste yours.(read fergie's autobiography. great book!)"
2,I commend Tehmina Durrani for having the courage to write this book. I hope she continues her writing career and I look forward to reading more of her writings.
1,"i ordered two of these bottles from amazon and and within a month, i noticed the lining on the neck of the bottle started peeling. so i contacted zigg and sent them back for a replacement. it's been a month, and i haven't gotten my replacement. i would recommend the camelbak bottles instead. you don't have to worry about a liner."
2,"This movie is great however do not confuse this DVD with the Godfather Trilogy. This film is not in chronological order as in the Godfather Trilogy. Trilogy is only available in VHS at this time.GodFather is great, the actors, storyline.I was thoroughly entertained however I will buy the chronological Trilogy version for it's completeness. Enjoy."
1,"I cannot appropriately rate this game, because i have not received it yet. But looks good. I hope it is NOT a 1st person character play."
2,first of all i got the whole good times episode. Brought back a lot of memories. I believe the container (box) for the dvds should be more sturdy just for collectors sake. Other than that it is very good and what i hoped for.
1,This is a really bad movie. Steve Guttenberg is a good comedic actor but does not appear to know how to play a serious role. He wears a tortured look on his face even before things go awry. The plot is routine and predictable. Sean Bean is the only bright spot as a bad guy but is not in the movie long enough to save it. Don't waste your time.
2,"The 'Kings of the Outback' series by Emma Darcy is made up of three novels: The Cattle King's Mistress, The Playboy King's Wife, and The Pleasure King's Bride. This story concludes the 'Kings' trilogy.Description from the book back cover:Christabel Valdez yearns to say yes to her boss - to Jared's dinner invitations and the sensual promise behind them. An intimate involvement with him is dangerous, but could she risk just one night to remember? Jared King will use everything he has to hold her, keep her. And, like his legendary family, who have flourished in this part of the Australian Outback, he will not be defeated by anything. For him, one night is not enough ...Kings Of The Outback - Three masterful brothers and the women who tame them."
2,Good product for the price. Sturdy and efficient with good volume for the water tank. Easy to use. On the negative side I shall mention the lack of a small steam tray to reach narrow areas. Overall a good buy.
2,I needed strong extentions for a curtain rod in order to go over another rod to complete the look I was going for...these are nice and strong. I did need to tap them down a bit to fit into the curtain rods but it worked and I am happy.
2,"No wind on my ears, my head toasty, it doesn't blow away in a gust, it isn't itchy and fits perfectly. I love this hat, which I wore in a recent trip to Hokkaido, Japan, in winter -- wind and snow were constant. I wanted something that was practical, and that covered my ears. The Dome Perignon worked fantastically well and will be my #1 hat in all winter trips."
2,"I will say that the concept this book adds of ""playing with future"" is the utmost importance for many of us who were tough by experience to survive and keep it running. The most important thing about work is to get it done...if not...it equals all us..we all lose That does not help a lot any organization. This books deals about how to get it done self sustained and fruitfull"
2,"This is the best book for anyone who supports breastfeeding mothers. It contains some medical terms and might not be the easiest read for non-technical types, but the overall information is clear and concise with lots of examples and diagrams. It contains lots of facts: tables of milk contents, drugs in milk, and so on."
2,"I got this for my child and he loves it. Order flowed as expected, easy as pie. Comics are still a great gift."
2,Great colored pencils. I gave them to my nephew for Christmas and he loves them.
1,"I had no idea about French when I first bought this tape, and after I listened to the first tape I still had no idea about French! It is impossible to learn French from these tapes! I spent two days listening to Lesson 1 trying to grasp its content, but it was very difficult. New words are introduced without explaining their meanings, they talk very fast, basic concepts are ignored, and the exercises are useless! After spending almost a month trying to learn from the tapes I decided to enroll in French classes. After a month now I am the best student so far and I can initiate basic conversations. I guess this means that the problem doesn't lie within me, it's with those tapes. I did however benefit from learning a few new French words, but that is not worth the cost at all."
2,Excellent learner for a child about a dark period of modern european history. told in the first person by a child of a holocaust survivor.
2,"These cards were on the Tonight show the other day, I bought the entire set! everybody loves them - great dog cards"
1,"I had seen several of these trailers with a red frame and thought that is what I was purchasing.Turns out this is an imported copy of an american made product, but they sure didn't copy it very well.The metal began rusting within a short time and the hinge pin for the bed wore through very quickly after a few uses.I do not recommend and this is the last time I order anything from Northern Tool."
1,"Strobel claims to be an investigative journalist, but his intellectual dishonestly destroys any credibility that he may have brought to the table. He rarely asks his subjects the hard questions that beg to be asked, and quite often he merely leads the interview in the direction that he wants the conversation to go. This is not an investigation of faith by any means, it is simply an affirmation of one mans faith."
1,although it answered a lot of questions it did not do much for me.. found it hard to get in to as its loads of different sections..
2,"Excellent easily read book explaining important reasons for various prayers and rituals involved in the Catholic Mass. Will definately improve your appreciation, respect, and love for the Mass. Even non-catholics would be more knowledgeable and realize why Catholics find the Mass so important!"
2,"Beautiful, ambient, rythmic and spacey. Along the lines of Tangerine Dream, but less intense. Fell in love with this album 20 years ago and have been looking to replace my LP with a CD but it's been out of print. FINALLY we get a re-release and it's only $9!! (makes me wish Edgar Froese would re-release his original Epsilon in Malaysian Pale, rather than having to consider rare out-of-print copies for $100+ ). Thank you, Reed."
1,I expected to get brand new markers in unused condition but what I received were markers that *looked* new.I used them once and capped them... I came back to use them the next day (the red and black markers) and the ink looked more like grey and light red... I wanted high quality markers which is why I came to the original brand... Disappointment.
1,I was delighted to find this booklet online however the 2 week wait will keep me from ordering from these people again.
1,"The ball without the rope is MUCH sturdier. Our Goldens destroyed this one within minutes, but the larger ball that has no rope is none the worse for wear after weeks of constant use."
1,"this piece of trash arrived on time, but only one speaker was working. thank God i know how to repair litle things like this 'cause returning them was not a economic option. when check inside the speaker i realized the damage was in the board. it took me almost 2 hours to fix the product. at least i wanted them to put my ipod in the bathroom AND NOW IS WORKING FINE thx to me not thx to seller (AMAZON). i understand iT was CHEAP, but CHEAP does not mean BROKEN."
1,"The plans are often inaccurate, e,g,. measurements for the temporary backbone are way off. The plank marks on the stem make no sense. Over size lumber is called for wasting a lot of money.I emailed Wooden Boat as no one was listed for help but never received an answer. Definately not for the first time builder."
1,"I never write reviews - but wanted to mention that as soon as I put these on, my 13 month walked over and open up the safety knob right away. Defeats the purpose to have these if she can open them. I removed them right way, as I didn't want anything on the stove that would peak her attention."
1,"DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE ... I HAD TROUBLE FROM DAY 1 .... CD SKIP , NOTHING WORKS RIGHT !"
2,It was a very enjoyable book. It was written well and easy to understand. I would read another book like this again.
2,"What fun this cowbell is! I purchased it as a gift for a family member to go with the SNL's DVD 'Best of Christopher Walken'....""I need more cowbell!"". Beside the joke aspect, the cowbell is loud enough to be used to call the family to dinner, or to get the kids' attention when they are arguing. Oh yes, if you belong to a band, a cowbell is a backbeat essential."
2,"Robert Doherty's fifth book in the ""Area 51"" series is just as strong an entry as the other four. Doherty (a/k/a Bob Mayer) continues to weave a very imaginative and entralling story about the role that two warring alien cultures played in the development of life on planet Earth.The protagionist of the series, Mike Turcotte, is his heroic and overall ornery self again in ""The Grail"". The other now-familar names to the fans of this series all play important parts again in this book.In simple terms, let me say that fans of this series will not be disappointed! If anything, ""The Grail"" is actually a stronger and consistently more entertaining read than the two previous ""Area 51"" novels - The Sphinx and The Mission. The Grail recaptures a lot of the cameraderie and action of the first two books.The ""Area 51"" is a book series that allows the reader great escapism. The always-imaginative Doherty has done it again!"
2,Wonderful and chewy! I love the taste AND texture of these and will keep on ordering them! Great gluten free candy option.
1,"While Road Fools 12 is an amazing video, I am disappointed that I was not warned prior to my purchasing this product that it was an ""e-movie"" or whatever it's called. I never would have bought it had I realized that it was not available in DVD format. I don't like the idea of sitting at the computer watching this entire video, and none of the devices I own are included in Amazon's list of compatible devices that will allow me to watch this on my TV. Furthermore, there is a ""no refund"" policy on these ""e-movies,"" so I am stuck with this $15 video that I have yet to, and probably never will, watch in its entirety. This is the first negative experience I have had with Amazon and I hope they will either change their refund policies or add a warning to these kinds of videos in the future."
2,"I first heard of Helio Sequence through Brandon's dad, whom I have the privilage of knowing. All of the reviews I've read for this band have been quite positive, and there's a great reason. Normally, this isn't my style of music, but it's hard not to sit back and enjoy the mood Helio creates. Furthermore, Brandon and Ben did everything on the album themselves and that deserves some major props. Go out on a limb and check out a band you may not have considered before. If nothing else, do it to support some true musicians."
1,"Somehow, no matter how great this kit looked online and even IN the package, it is still a bad kit. The case was too small to hold my PSP 2000 (which is SMALLER than the original PSP) and the cartridge holders without breaking the zipper (which it did twice when I tried). I do not know how the dock fits other PSPs, but it did not fit mine (cheap plastic anyway). The headphones turned out to be slimmed down to fit in that nifty roll-up container and as good as listening through three layers of cardboard. I did not use screen protector because I wanted to return it, and I do not even WANT to know what the car adapter would have done to my PSP..."
1,"Too bad this arrived in a ripped bag. I ordered everything I needed to make several recipes I wanted to try, and now I have to order it again or buy it somewhere else. Amazon says they can't just replace it because the inventory comes from someone else, and the refund could take up to 4 weeks after they receive the return. Just crappy service all around."
1,"As I said in the title Harmful. Not very stimulating, fun and if you were expecting to hide behind the sofa just through that idea out of the window. Basically one man wakes up from hospital 'unharmed' after a bomb has wiped out the everyone in England. Or so it seems. A few survivors are there to help but the rest are all mutants trying to eat their skin and so on.No plot.No stars.No good scenes.No sense.Don't waste good money. Try 'The Shining'."
2,"Well, this is certainly a refreshing book. The tone is conversational, but the content is technical. However, the book is easy to use as a way to learn ASP. One thing that is a bit of a bother is the reliance on the .DLLs that ship with the book. I didn't have the time to fool around with installing examples and stuff that I can't see myself using or needing. But, you can just skip over these without losing understanding, if you want."
1,"This book is not a good book.It stunk! You should not read this book because, there was absolutely no suspense.This book is very bad because there is also no action.It was also very preppy.It especially needs more suspense.It [smells]!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"I found this DVD to be of Not very good quality, I would not recommend, Just remember you get what you pay for."
2,Great product.. Doesn't take up as much lengthwise space. The bag just velcro's over your present closet rod. Works in double rod closets.
2,"I purchased these lights as a gift for my father. He said they were very easy to install and they look absolutely beautiful and give plenty of light. I would definitely recommend these lights, especially for this price. I own a different set of electric lights from Malibu, and they are great too."
2,"I bought this for my son. He said it works great, & he likes the headphones that came with it. He said the others wouldn't stay in his ears correctly. Also said the volume is great too."
1,"I took this product back because the fabric doesn't fit the base of the toy as well as the base is very hard and uncomfortable for a baby; especially an infant.The other thing that I did not like about it, is the fact it doesn't fold up to make it easy to store. You have this huge piece of plastic always on your den floor."
1,"why 63 dollars for 46 pages? this is sad money grubbing, ehy would anyone pay that, for someone so right...... this turns my insides out. i hope all this money goes to some place that helps people, and not into someone pockets, just from someone trying to complete the series"
2,"Whoever thinks that a metal band should not be fronted by a woman is either very close-minded or got his butt whooped by a woman, or both. Arch Enemy is a good example of a band with a frontwoman who can hold her own onstage, and knows how to whip the crowd into a frenzy while the music just rips their heads off. The extras are plentyful as you get interviews, behind the scenes of the making of the My Apocalypse video, behind the scenes tour footage, music videos, and even footage of drummer Daniel Erlandsson and guitarist Michael Amott discussing the gear they use. The main concert itself however is what makes this worth getting. The sound is just simply amazing. Every riff, cymbal, bass hit, etc. is crystal clear. Note that when Andy Sneap is involved in recording and/or mixing processes for cd's and dvd's, most likely it's gonna be sick. I can't stress that enough. He adds a bit of grittyness to recordings and makes it sound brutal. Arch Enemy fans won't be disappointed."
2,"What a wonderful set at an unbeatable price. I was fortunate enough to purchase this 2-piece OXO Apple set during the 4-for-3 promotion. I recently bought a Vita-Mix and needed to be able to core and slice my apples quickly. This corer does the trick--fast! I use the peeler for some vegetables--never for potatoes or apples--because I value the flavor and nutrition that are in the peels. But when I need an excellent peeler, this one is IT!"
2,Now it's Evan's turn to grow. Only this time the Blood is creating havoc worse than it did in the last two.
1,"When I saw the gorgeous bike on the cover I had to buy this. A sculptured frame and single sided rear plus the title ""Techno-chop"" gives the impression that you are about to see some unusual, technically challenging artistic and creative bikes.BUT.........Sadly when you read and look at the pictures it's the same old stuff that we have all seen before. Mediocre pictures wrapped up in excessive jounalistic mumbo jumbo. Reading it will send you to sleep. Some parts were boring enough to skip altogether. It appears to me that someone was offered $xxxx to write 5000? words on custom motorcycles and sat down and did it.If you are looking for inspiration to do something yourself and fancy the type of bike on the cover, then like me you will be disappointed. I couldn't even find out who made that bike - there is no credit that I can find in the book. You could probably get better information but searching on Google.BUY SOMETHING ELSE!!!"
1,"There are a few nuggets of value to be gleaned from this dvd. But overall, I was not too impressed. I did not like the format. They'd have a person say something for like 30 seconds then move on to another person for another 30 second blurb and so on and so on. Some of the things said are just plain silly which takes away from the credibility of the entire program."
2,"Very often the finances of cruising are left out of the discussion, and here it is not. It's really an inspiration. Still, I think it's important to note that Anne doesn't sail a junk anymore, and that she's living a bit different life that's perhaps a bit more moderate. Also try ""Sea-steading"" Jerome FitzGerald to fill out the vision a bit, get them both."
1,In my opinion the D'Addario EJ26 is very poor sounding set of acoustic strings. These are nowhere near as bright as DR strings and the snap was gone after one day of use. I went into a small shop that I became aware of close to home and they didn't have DRs so on the salesman's recommendation I tried D'Addario. This will be the last time. I'll drive the extra miles for DRs.
2,"I love every single song on this soundtrack! I love the movie too! They are all cool, and it's not ""pop"" like... it has more reggae and rap and stuff."
1,"The iRock's sound quality is on par for most of these FM transmitters, they all sound bad. I was aware of the sound limitations when I bought the iRock, my big issue is the design and placement of the power button. It is set up in such a way if you put it in your glove box (or just about anywhere) you can guarantee something will press the power button and run down the batteries. Very frustrating. The iRock also limits you to only four station radio choices, 88.1, 88.3 etc. Since I live in Boston, a fairly large city with many, many colleges, those frequency are being used. So the iRock is useless for me when I am downtown. As soon as I get out of the city I'm fine. There has to be a better unit out there."
2,"This seat is easy to install, looks very comfortable (baby doesn't look awkward or uncomfortable and doesn't fuss) and has been highly rated for safety. My only complaint about this seat is that there are no strap covers and I found it very difficult to find basic, soft, non-bulky strap covers. The edge of the straps leave red marks on my child's neck, so I ended up purchasing some that are bulkier than I'd like, but they work. We used a bucket seat when my son was an infant, so I can't speak to that, and he is currently 16 months old, so I'm not sure how it will fare as he gets older and bigger, but so far I am very happy with this seat."
2,I am from Korea. This dictionary was beyond my description. I also recommand a porket dictionay pubished by Cobuild.
2,"Forget about great sound with these, but it is adequate...the package said something about bass enhancement or such, but forget it. I've had others that had better bass. However, these are the most comfortable phones I've ever used, and I can sometimes almost forget that they are there. They don't produce much pressure on my ears. They are good for exercising, and the behind-the-head design seems most likely to stay on. The color looks good with the Sandisk m240(also good for exercise). Thecord is a decent enough length, too. For cheap, comfortable headphones for exercise or working out in the yard, these are hard to beat."
1,Author does a decent review of SOME of the facts; his conclusion that AE simply ditched is no more convincing than TIGHAR's theory she crash landed on Gardner Island.
1,"I'm on my 4th antenna since I bought my Stiletto 2 years ago. That's an added $80 per year added to the cost of owning Sirius radio. Make a better product, make a product the end user can repair or redo your entire business model so consumers don't feel robbed and eventually abandon your product for something more reliable. SHAME ON YOU SIRIUS."
1,"The topics covered in this book are very good. It is a good reference book for mechanical engineering students doing an intermediate course in turbomachinery. However, due to the numerous typing errors, the 3rd edition is actually a better book. It makes it very challenging to follow, especially for students. Also, the theory is sometimes rather cryptic and one can do with a bit more detail in places. The velocity triangles can definitely do with more detail. The section on nozzles and diffusers is good, albeit a bit short."
1,"My 6 mo old loves your baby can read dvds. They are great and I wish they had some dvds with emphasis on numbers, too (Your baby can count??). In the market for a learning dvd on numbers, I stumbled upon baby bumblebee numbers dvd. AWFUL. It isto sooooooooo slow (as in drawn-out speaking slow...so tortuous), boring, not entertaining. First, the music is very drawn out. Even the people speaking in the video speak verg monotonic. And the singing? Gosh, awful singing! Wish they can spice it up with more upbeat people or use music that's catchy.Even though my child is only 6 mo, she knows which DVD sucks (looks elsewhere, wiggles out of her bumbo) and which is more entertaining (sits in her Bumbo, eyes glued to the your baby can read dvds). I am no spokesperson for YBCR nor do I absolutely love their products but the YBCR songs are very catchy, entertaining, and thus, keep your child's attention longer for the learning to take place."
1,"After much deliberation on my part I decided to Order a Brightman Cd and find out what all the fuss was about. I was unpleasently surprised. Sarah's voice, all though pleasent at first soon becomes annoying and titery. I would also say that although good, I am surpprised she got anywhere in life singing the way she does (a whole lot of air.)I'm sure fans will be pleased with this cd, but for anyone who likes the richness of opera music, don't bother."
2,"Well, this ain't a bad Cd at all, although some would find it too ""commercial"" for Laibach standards. The sound is quite good and the Video is interesting to watch, although I expected (I don't know why) something more spectacular (too used to Rammstein's ""Live in Berlin"" video?). The only problem is that this Cd is a kinda collection of other bands' hits as versioned by Laibach taken from former Laibach's Cds, with only a couple of compositions of their own. But anyway, I would recommend this Cd plus video pack to every Laibach fan and to those who want to introduce themselves into this Slovenian band style. Not a bad choice at all. Buy it, you won't regreit it..."
2,the cd case that I received was in good shape and brand new came at a good time fast quick service had no problems with this seller was fast and convenient
1,"I sprayed this outside with many coats since i had bought two cans. It does not glow in the dark at all, and now it is stuck on my stairs. Also, there was very little in each, expensive can. i wish i could get my money back. I'm sad i spent all that money on two products and both , the spray and tape do not work. Please credit me."
2,"If you're not convinced by my review go to zapfcreation.com and go to ""Today I Am"" where you can see a picture of Baby Born wearing this fantastic outfit. This is the most beautiful princess outfit I've ever seen. I'm ten and love Zapf and Corolle dolls so much!!!! This outfit looks stunning and so cute on Baby Born. You and her will love playing any princess game with this outfit. It's worth buying the doll just for it!!!SO CUTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"I purchased this toy as a stocking stuffer. It was used once, and then it was never heard from again..."
1,"Except for slow changing of discs, especially in shuffle mode, the unit performed well for the first week. After that there has been a repetitive problem of discs not falling properly into their respective slots after play. Sometimes the CDs fall into the interior of the player and can be fished out easily after removing the unit's cover, but often they jam and result in damaged CDs. I no longer use the unit. It is still kept in my audio rack for appearance, as I had to customize the rack to accept a player its size."
2,"This is certainly the way to go if your looking into getting into the World of Warcraft.This game doesn't really break into new grounds in terms of gameplay. Mostly with kill 7 ""wolves or goblins"" is what your going to be doing alot of the time. They do a fairly decent job of mixing it up so that it doesn't get too overly redundant.Gameplay is very good and fairly easy to pick up. My only wish would be to make it a bit harder since it seems a bit too easy at times. The world is seamless without load screens (except for when traveling) which is very nice.The only real problem I had was that at times the community gets very annoying. Lots of it can thankfully be blocked out via filters. As a whole it has more good players than bad.While I don't play too much of it anymore. Have to split time with Horizons while stuck working six days a week. Sort of cramps your video game time. I'd certainly reccommend this game especially the $40 chest since your getting a good deal."
2,a wonderful little piece of film noir that will be right at home in any horror or suspense fans library. well done alan parker
1,Full of Junk...Waste of money and time. This is a defective book about a defective product..
1,"I have two dogs, 40 lbs. and 80 lbs. These tethers will not hold either one. Also, they will only stick to a smooth surface. So if you have a textured tile shower, forget it."
1,This sharpener did not work from the first time I attempted to use it. It only hummed when a pencil was inserted into the sharpener. It seems like the motor is bad or just too weak. I’m sending it back.I do NOT recomend this item.
1,"Didn't work with my Mac. DIDn't work at all, defective, returned for immediate fund which was handled in a timely manner."
2,"I realy liked how Charmander and Squirtle joined Ash by choice and how Bulbasaur, as stubbern as Ash, put up a fight."
2,"We have made several purchases from Amazon.com, and have never been disappointed. Each order has been received in excellent condition and more timely than was indicated. We are relatively new to on-line shopping and our experience has been exceptional. We now prefer on-line rather than physical visits to retailers. It is usually less expensive and service is fantastic."
2,"If you like combining your notes, briefs, etc. in one electronic package, this is a great resource. I, personally, prefer software for class and not exam prep. For exams, there are some disadvantages to paper-based study guides and I would treat this as a supplement and tool rather than a complete replacement for other tools (unless you like living in a paperless world). I'm a visual learner and I find that the books help me on exams when I can remember where on a page I saw something. If you find that you learn best by doing things with the text (copying, pasting, dissecting, re-organizing), this might work better for you."
1,I got this charger for my daughters Nintendo DS lite because she lost the original that came with the device. ..I SHOULD HAVE SPRANG FOR THE EXTRA 2.00 AND GOT A NEW ONE AT THE STORE!!...it quit charging last week and i had to spend even more money on a new one...not worth it go to the store and pay for a new one!
2,"If you are a fan of The Mamas and the Papas, then this is definitely a must-have for your collection. Only complaint is some of the vocal tracks are muted too much on a few tracks."
1,"different band than the great Mike Patton/Dan the Automator Lovage. I wish i knew before i bought it, but no opinion on it, haven't listened to it mcuh yet."
2,This works and I really just got it to get some information of my palm. It has kinda become obslete because I use my phone for everything that the palm can do and more.
2,"My background - can play guitar and have had a harmonica sitting in its case for 8 years. I previously bought a beginners harmonica book and learnt how to play Twinkle Twinkle Little Star which kept me enthused for 5 minutes. Read the reviews for Jon Gindicks books and decided to order this one. Well, one week later and I have improved already. The good thing is that it gives you the basics and you build on them. You listen to the included CD to hear what you should sound like and practice until you get it right (or close to it). The main thing it teaches you, and encourages you to do is make it up as you go. So as you learn one blues riff you mix it with the others you already know and soon you have your own style. I look forward every day to sitting down and practicing blues harp thanks to this book. It teaches you how to play, and just as importantly, motivates you to keep playing and learning. Recommended for anybody wanting to learn blues harp."
2,"I have read many agatha Christie books! I enjoy when the plot gets alittle twisted, and this book delivers that. By the end of the book, the reader is still guessing who done it! And why..."
1,"I wanted to like this band and album...we live in the same town. However, I found the album to be very generic. The vocals were very uninspired and strained. With all the comparisons to Third Eye Blind (which is very misguided, I might add) I'd rather listen to Third Eye Blind's first album than this.With every new band sounding like this, it's going to be hard for bands of this style to stand out. These guys are just another generic face in the crowd."
2,"This compilation of the more sedate and ambient works from some of the artists on the Spotted Peccary label is a great collection and serves as a fine introduction to the ""new"" direction in which the label is headed. Many of the cuts are halfway between drifting serene ""warm"" ambient and darker soundscapes. But nothing here is the least bit disturbing or disonnant. Flowing synth washes, subtle percussive elements, warm undertones and drones, and spacy electronics all combine seamlessly, cut to cut, to produce an compilation that plays through superbly. It's almost as if this is the work of one artist in that the emotional and musical tone is sustained throughout the CD.If you've never explored this label, and you enjoy floating ambient or spacemusic, you can't go wrong picking this up. It's a very solid album."
2,"This movie begins in 1953, the year I was born. I had no expectations when I watched it on TV; I didn't know anything about the movie. I continued to watch because of the cast and the artful, creative opening sequence. I liked that there was no plot, it just kept going on, like real life. The period outfits, cars, sets and hairdos seemed perfect to me. The screenplay never gets boring, it is continually interesting. I recommend this film if you are tired of the same old predictable plots and action sequences."
1,"Package arrived very quickly, with in 4 days. Wrapped discreetly, with no damage.We had been using the Pjur Eros Original Silicone Lubricant, which we liked a lot. We decided to try the Pjur Eros GEL Bodyglide mainly for the thicker formula. Was disappointed all the way around. The Pjur Eros GEL Bodyglide did not provide as much lubrication, seemed not to last very long. And I really did not like the thicker feel. I'll stick with the Pjur Eros Original Silicone Lubricant."
2,"I have always been a Madden fan, but when I found out that the XBox version would not have online capabilities, I was very disappointed. I had NFL Fever 2002, and was very impressed. But when I saw NFL 2K3 had signed a deal with ESPN, I was blown away. The place I get games from had it this past Tuesday, and no one else gets it until next week!! The Sega Sports Challenge alone is worth the game. I mean, NFL Fever was great, but how many times did the game allow you to burn the DB's??? If you want realism, this is the game. Also, hint, if you are an ESPN fan...LET THE GAME COMPLETELY LOAD UP!!!"
1,"Love Michael Jackson, hate this album. Not only Michael's worst album, but one of the most terrible albums ever recorded by anybody. Ever."
1,"While this movie may be more ""believeable"" than Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, it was a poorly directed film with awful choices for casting the characters. I mean, Bill Murray as a Gonzo journalist? I kept thinking ""Groundhog Day"", and Saturday Night Live everytime I saw him. And I don't think I have to say anything about to choice of the casting of the attorney. If you've seen the movie, then enough said about it. While this movie will probably be viewed more in 98-99 due to Fear and Loathing's success, don't expect it to impress you much, and if you thought Fear and Loathing had no plot [which it did], then don't look for one in this movie."
1,"I am so disappointed. Just bought a new Palm TX after during more than a year of bad service and screaming noise from Palm TE. I thought that the Palm would have resolved the screen whine problem by now. But in less than 10 hours, my brand new Palm TX is screaming at me again. And I am so ashamed to write this, being aware of this problem of previous Palms but still falling into the trap of trusting the company too much. I hope that Palm would try to solve this once and for all, and reward its fans with a decently built PDA. Currently, at least I could get my full refund when I returned it to the shop the next day (in Singapore). Am now using my good 'ol Palm M515."
2,"They fit my 18 month old son great. The Velcro is kind of a pointless feature. The strap that is suppose to stick didn't even really reach when the floats are fully inflated.I have a problem with the valves not sealing and letting air out quicker than I can plug them up. I reported the problem to the company, and they sent a replacement pair immediately. Unfortunately, I had the same problem with the second pair. I think it may just be the way they're made."
1,"I loved The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay, and I also liked The Final Solution, which was a mystery novella by Chabon, so I was excited to read this. Of course, it's amazingly written. I give the prose five stars. But that's not enough to save it. To put it simply, the story is just terribly boring. It never gets interesting. Around page 300, I said to myself, ""Okay, it's gotta start picking up soon."" But it just didn't. It's not that I don't appreciate great prose. I do. But I don't see much point in reading beautiful words that tell a boring story when I could be reading beautiful words that tell an interesting story, like his other works or works by other authors. I'm not giving up on Chabon though. I'll probably read the next book he writes. I just hope it's more interesting than The Yiddish Policemen's Union."
2,"This book gets to the point with the basics showing how to do a job in detail with clear, concise instructions and drawings showing details that ensures professional performance. A must for a builder or tradesman engaged in the construction trades. I wouldn't start a job without it and I've been in the construction business for a good man years."
2,i will consider these book as a good book because the way it was written was somehow historical but the story is a nice story book
2,"Most mantras require the discipline of 108 times a day for 40 days. I shared the ""find a masculine man"" mantra with my daughter. She said it 108 times and found a great boyfriend immediately. Maybe coincidence?The Virgin Knows: an art theft thriller"
2,"The album was pretty good. I remember helping them make copies of cassettes back in 1996 and wondering ""I wish there was a faster way to make copies and make them sound better."" RIP J.A.Y."
2,"This is Bel Canto at its finest! Beautiful, haunting and moving! I love Renee, she's gorgeous, very talented and the best soprano I ever heard!"
1,"Enough with the drunk Indians, If they cannot learn to deal with the world as it is now, use productive work, discipline and self respect (like their forbears) there is nothing we can learn from these fools.Other peoples have been persecuted, displaced, conquered and have resureccted themselves, Instead the Indians lament the past and stay drunk."
2,I really like the Stephanie Plum series and decided to start at the beginning. There is actually a different reader on One for the Money than on some of the later books I have listened to but both readers have been great. Fun books and I would recommend this to anyone--funny as well as a bit of a mystery.
1,"My well meaning husband purchased this shaver for my birthday. After using it a few times for one hour on each leg to get a semi-smooth look, I thought it was a major waste of time and money. My beef isn't just with the shaver, it's with the ridiculous wall/outlet charger. Nevermind trying to plug in anything under it as it hangs a little down ...and you definitely can't plug in anything above it while the shaver is charging. You also have to push it into the outlet very hard to make it stay in to charge completely.If you have baby fine hairs on your legs, then this is the shaver for you. Forget about under the arm or the bikini line, though, cause this ""shaver"" is more of a hair ""saver""."
1,"Griffith overlooks several key battles and ""fudges"" with some numbers to come to his conclusions.His discussion of the infantry firefight left me wanting and his writing is difficult to read.In the end, I found nothing new revealed that I didnt already know."
1,"This is the second EZ reader I have purchased. They both were cheaply made; and even though the directions to assemble them are easy to follow, the product iteself does not assemble well. This last one is tilted because the threads do not match up. I have tried to remedy it a couple of times by disassembling and assembling it again to no avail."
2,"This band is perty damn funny. The music is so good you'll want to sing it out loud, but can't in public because of the lyrics. The skits between the songs get a bit boring after awhile, but they're fresh for the first few listens. Soon you'll be skipping to the songs, though, which are classic, and generate great rock-and-roll emotions in the listener. I can't wait for their next album."
2,"I bought this Perky Pet Squirrell Resistant Easy Feeder for my brother in law. It easily holds pounds of feed. Just beware the vender says ""squirrel resistant"" not ""squirrel proof."" He no sooner had the feeder hanging than 2 squirrels decided to check it out, leaving the birds standing in line. By the second day, a raccoon took the feeder down in order to have his turn. My brother in law is making plans on a different means of hanging this feeder to keep it raccoon resistant. Until then, he'll keep using his long range squirt gun in case the squirrels over stay their turn at the feeder."
1,This is a terrible iron. Do not buy it. It blows water out of the bottom two holes. It is so bad that the iron is sitting in a pool of water shortly after starting to use it. It soaks the clothes you are trying to press. I have used almost everyday for several weeks and it does not get better. I'm going to try and get my money back and buy a different iron.
1,"I read reviews about this solar panel, and they talked about the weak soldering of the cord to the solar panel. In the face of the other reviews that praised its benefit, I decided to take my chances.This panel works fine, but if you don't handle with care, it'll stop functioning all at once, like mine.The bad thing about it is that it must be hidden from sunlight when the engine is ignited, otherwise, they'll be really hot. May be they don't have a protection circuit.... I Think this should be taken care of in the design."
1,"This book is advertised as being 128 pages, but it is actually only 104 pages (which includes 2 blank pages). There are some charts/graphs/tables that really aren't necessary for the book, but were probably added to try and pump up the page count. In reality, all the biostats you need could be covered in 50 pages or less (including some practice questions), but I suppose the author and publisher couldn't justify charging $29.95 for something that small.Worst of all, I found a few errors. I'd list them here, but then I'd feel like I'm working for free for the author and publisher."
2,"I purchased 3 of these DVD's, but not all from the same vendor. I don't know if there was an issue with the DVD company that made the DVD or not, but I have had certain issues with the actual DVD that is not the vendors' problem. My friend, who received the 3rd as a gift, loved it and has had no problems. It's a TERRIFIC movie, especially for train lovers and people that do the right thing, because it's the right thing to do!! ROCK ON!!"
2,"In the interest of full disclosure, I write for Realmoney.com, as does the author of this book. That said, I say this with the utmost objectivity: This book is a must-read for any investment professional.As I wrote in my book review on Realmoney: I devoured James Altucher's new book, Trade Like Warren Buffett this weekend. At the risk of gushing, the book is fantastic and extremely readable, and it blasts all kinds of the the conventional myths around the greatest investor/trader that the world has ever known.My favorite chapter -- the last one, called ""Jealousy."" Yeah, jealousy. As in player-hating. I've decided that the downfall of the modern world won't come from nukes or terrorism -- but from player-hating. Buffett's the best, and he's been rewarded for it. The facts speak for themselves.Great, great job, James. Rock on.Long ALTUCHER Leaps in Size"
1,When I received the chi it was working fine the first time. Then it wouldn't show that it was heated up. I noticed the metal plates were coming out. I pushed them back in and it now burns my hair. Complete waste of money.
1,"Not a useful study of hosea, not in depth. No explanation. And horrible theology. This is not a commentary, but more of an attempt at a small group bible study guide."
2,"I really like this cooker. Somewhat different than expected but after using it, I am sold. Nice size."
1,"I shouldve looked and returned the set (i had already trown away the box and everything else).look at the stamp on the blade. it says MADE IN CHINA.there is NO WAY, to trace this material back to Germany. obviously, they dont (sure will not) provide an MTR for the material used to make the blade.I assure if it was MADE in china, the material also came from china, which they normally alter / lie about the materials (carbon content, Nickel content, Mg, Mn, etc...).This is now what I had wanted to have/purchase for my kitchen.can I still return them???I will try to contact the vendor."
1,"I find it hard to believe anyone thinks this movie is funny. John Leguizamo was much funnier in ""To Wong Fu..."" and appears here as just silly, childish, and seeking attention in unfunny, overly hyperactive ways. The only redeeming feature of this flick is the character Himmel (played by Edoardo Ballerini), son of the villain Jeff Jones (who is in about every movie ever made). 70% of the 5 or 6 good jokes in this movie are his.All in all, don't waste your money. But if you are in the mood for some stupid slapstick and don't mind having your intelligence compromised and insulted every few minutes, go for it."
2,"I used these on my Ridgid JP0610 Jointer and they are at least as good as the blades that came with the unit. They already have little nicks in them, which is about what the stock blades did too. For the price they are very reasonable. If you want basically the same blades that came with your Ridgid, these work fine. They are not an upgrade, but may very well be the most cost effective solution. I bought a couple sets to make sure I don't run out again. As always they were shipped promptly and arrived on time and un damaged."
1,"Sorry, but public opinion dictates that Pink Floyd are out of favor and out of style. Get any American Idol album instead. Thank you for reading."
2,"This is my daughter's absolute favorite DVD. The animation is excellent, the stories are excellent and I have to say, this is the only kids show that doesn't grate on my nerves after the dozens of times she watches it. You, the adult, will actually enjoy it the first couple of times; really!"
2,"The Paradise Snare was a great book. It captured Han Solo's character very well and the Star Wars feeling.(though not as good as Zahn)It had a lot of action, and drama that explored the depth of the story. I liked the way the author made this book."
1,"I can't believe Hawkins can knowlingly publish obvious Falsehoods as Truth!p.31: How on earth can these ""Grazer and Exception"" animals calibrate higher than 75% of humans???p.114: Hawkins' comments on Bill O'Reily make NO SENSE... ""the rule of the thumb is that if O'Reilly dislikes a public figure or a ""cause"", it calibrates below 200 (handy for those who cannot do the calibration technique)"" So forget everything Hawkins has ever written based on kinesiology and simply watch Bill O'Reilly!!!p.115: How on earth can 2004 Election Republican voters calibrate at 405 and Conservatives calibrate at 415 - supporting Bush and the unwarranted war on Iraq while peace-wishing Liberals calibrate at only 255??There are many very questionable calibrations here and I couldn't read any more of this after reaching only page 124.This is a HUGE disappointment after Hawkins 3 previously enlightening books."
2,"I've had this lock for over a year and it's still protecting my bike. I have noticed a few digs into it, penetrating the plastic sheath and showing a little wear on the metal interior, meaning it's successfully thwarted theft attempts. U-locks are awesome and sometimes I want to cut someone's dinky chains (and not take the bike) just to show that they should really get a U-lock."
1,Same comment as above. Since I can't play the DVD how can I review it. The DVD I received is defective.
1,"Reading this book shows how far some will go with 'just-so' stories and hypothetical 'explanations' that substitute for expositions of what really happened. Having a plausible, Occam's Razor sort of alibi for every miraculous emergence that cannot be rationally explained without CreatorGodWhoCares doesn't make evolution really so; it's 'just so'.The question begging to be answered at book's end is: given that one chooses to believe all we observe arose from evolution, where did evolution itself come from? Dawkins admits evolution evolves, so please tell us why the evidence reveals not Creation ex nihilo, but Creation ex creatio? All the apparent design is blind, dumb, mindless designation imposed coincidentally on our evolved brains to notice that all the apparent design needs a rational explanation or explaining away?Poof! Everything nested solo from scratch?If so, think, Braille, think: there is a catch -Can we deny First Hatcher given hatch?"
1,False advertising! Tide totally puts fragrance in their fragrance-free products--just a lot less than in the standard version. I'm going back to Trader Joe's fragrance free detergent.
2,"As a member of BTNH, Bizzy has put together another album of Pure Harmony. ""The Gift"" is a remarkable piece of Music that goes to show that you don't always need to Rap, Sing or Commit violence to get your message across to the youth of todays world. Bizzy and BTNH has always promoted God into there life and through there music has slowly been changing the world of Hip Hop Thugster Music from what we've always know and was used to. I am huge fan of BTNH for all they represent, but even if your not as much of a fan as I am, you will surely enjoy ""The Gift"" by Bizzy Bone."
1,"I haven't heard this disc, but I CAN clear up the way the music was credited. If you look back through all of the Beatles discs, all Lennon AND McCartney tunes were credited ""Lennon-McCartney"". Therefore, the above references are correct in repeating that formula."
1,did not honor price I bought it for bad customer servicehad no idea pricing was wrong and now they will not honorBeware customer service no help
2,This has been a good read ... I am about halfway through. He provided great insite into the world of the Birdman...
1,"From day one the max volume on the handset was too low on a lot of calls, and I don't have a hearing problem. Had it for less than a year and it started making a lot of weird noises when I was on calls. Granted, the handset had been dropped a few times, but still it should have lasted longer than it did. Phone book is terrible (only allows for 10 presets). Base unit is ugly. Ugh. Don't waste your money on this thing."
2,"Starting with Way of the Warrior with its introduction of Worf and its large scale battle scenes, the series really takes off this season. The Visitor may be DS9's best episode and certainly its most heartfelt. It also contains the fun episodes Little Green Men, Our Man Bashir, and Bar Association; the suspenseful Homefront/Paradise Lost two-parter; the tragic love stories Crossfire, Rejoined and For the Cause; and many other strong episodes. Season Four also ses the introduction of series regulars Martok, Weyoun, and Joseph Sisko as well as the welcome return of many others (especially Tony Todd as Worf's brother Kurn). The Muse seems to be the weakest episode of the season, but its not nearly as bad as other season's weakest spots. Overall, not as strong as season six or seven, but Deep Space Nine was that rare show that got stronger each year and rewarded viewers who took the time to watch from the beginning."
2,"I heard some pieces of this musin on NPR, and put it on my list. Finally got it for christmas. Ver nice music. Highly recommended."
1,"This book marks the first time Garfield ventured from the comic strips.Since this book was published, he has been featured in books, cartoons, movies, and countless tie-in toys and products.In this early outing, Garfield and Jon look quite a bit different from how they look today. Jon looks thin and anemic (even moreso than later), while Garfield looks fatter and uglier, like a grizzled old feline Walter Matthau. Odie looks basically the same.As the seminal edition, I would recommend this to anyone who likes their Garfield on the bookshelf rather than in the funnies."
1,"I bought these for my kids toys, been using these for almost 2 months now.I am happy with the product."
1,"I love Vegas and books about Vegas so it pains me to tell you that I truthfully hated this book. I was tempted to not even finish it, although I've never walked out on a book before.I found the writing style to be sort of... archaic, I guess. It sounds like it was written in the 50s, or by a guy who is in his 80s (which may be the case, I don't know).But primarily I disliked it because it simply cannot be a factual account. A few of the cheating methods he discussed are quite simply impossible. Even Madonna french-kissing Britney Spears at the craps table would not have been enough distraction to pull off what they supposedly did.Some of the side stories were interesting, but nowhere near enough to recommend this book."
1,My husband rented this movie. He thought it would be better then what it was. I could not make heads or tails on what was going on or what the movie is really about. It is to long ( over 2 hours) and drawen out. It really don't make any sense. This movvie I would not recommend this for kids due to the language and the sexual content.( It is rated R for a reason) My husband said it should go on the wrost movie list. Save your money and don't buy this movie. You might want to rent this movie frist and see for your ownself if you like it or not before you spend your money on it.
2,"My son loves trains in any form, toys, real ones... He loves this video! It has a mix of real and toy trains, with nice background music. Not to mention entertaining bloopers!"
2,"Zatoichi is a great movie. I haven't watched Sonatine yet, but since Asano is a top-notch actor, I have high expectations. The set was received in perfect condition in a timely manner. A good purchase."
2,Made my mossberg 500 look pretty slick and does what its supposed to. Would definitely buy it again if I buy another shotgun.
1,See the review for CD of Shakespeare Musick (Musicians of the Globe). My nonreturnablecopies will donated to my local library. Don't decide to buy this product unless you'veheard the entire CD.
1,This game is like the Resident Evil games but worse. It's not at all scary. I'm sorry but Zombies and monsters are MUCH more scarier than Velociraptors and the T-Rex. This is just a RE clone which in itself isn't bad except the way that the plot goes and how they made the game makes it so it's not at all scary. Oh well. If you're really into the genre then it's worth a rental but otherwise don't waste your time.
1,"I like her other books, but this one was ridiculous. I know there was supposed to be a message behind it, about feminism and Christianity, which could be true. But the rest of it, where is that coming from? It's just like some bargain basement historical romance."
1,Havent used yet but plan on soon it looks easy to use and I will soon but just havent yet
1,A lot of tasteless nudity that was not needed. It had its funny moments but none of it was laugh out loud funny mostly chuckle funny. I was disapointed in this movie and I thought it was just all around bad. This movie was also degrading of women making them appear to be easy. I hated it.
2,"This is a great little book - thought provoking, entertaining, and with insights into human nature. I'll be reading it again periodically to keep myself motivated in my new business venture."
1,"I bought this album based on the track Waterfalls (One Love Remix). I thought this entire track list would be more ""trip hoppy"" but I was TOTALLY WRONG!! Its nothing I thought it was and wish I would of bought a value meal at McDonalds instead."
2,"This whistling tea kettle heats enough water to make two 12-oz cups of tea, hot cocoa, etc. The whistle starts as a cute little chirping sound as the water begins to create steam, then progresses to a rather loud, sharp whistling that you just can't ignore. The easy-fill opening is very nice, too. Don't overfill, though, because you'll end up with a hot, wet mess on your stove top."
2,"When I purchased this item, I had searched for changing tables. Since this item came up, I assumed it was a ""combo"" dresser & changing table. It can definitely NOT be used as a changing table. It is still a nice piece of furniture & looks very nice put together."
1,Angelina Jolie plays a too-cool-for-the-room superspy. Great for people who haven't figured out the cold war is over. The movie is a strung together series of stereotypes and cliches and the acting is over-the-top stupid-serious.
2,"I thought this movie was DAMN good. It was a pleasure to watch and very nicely directed. Kudos to Kelly Rowland. This was the first time I've seen her in a movie and she's done a wonderful job (Others may disagree), but who cares.Nicely done"
1,"I was so excited to read this book as there are so few novels about Eleanor of Aquitane. Unfortunately, this book is HORRID. I mean they talk about Eleanor being dilated during one of her labors, come on I am sure they had no idea about this sort of stuff in Eleanor's time. That is just one example of the sloppy research the author has conducted. This reads like some Jean Plaidy paperback but is 3x the length."
1,"Leave it. Total (...) and a quick attempt to cash in on SUPERNATURAL. Eveything sound's like left over nonsense. It is over for Carlos, sad to say. His git playing is OK, but as a SANTANA band, he has nothing to say musically. Arista will bite the bullet & $$$ on this release."
1,"I bought this pricey little bottle of Lens Dr. hoping that it could extend the life of my expensive glasses but what a mistake! It did nothing but make it worse! After I saw what it did to the lenses, I had to scrape and scrub to get it off! I hope that no one else will waste their money on this worthless product.A BIG RIP OFF"
1,"In theory, I thought this product would be great. Unfortunately, I tried three separate sets of batteries, but to no avail."
1,"As I was gearing up to take the Library Media Specialist (#42) PLACE exam in Colorado, I was really excited when I found this book! It says right on the cover that it is for the Colorado test and everything looked great... 125 study questions and all!When I got the book, however, the cover states (in very small print in the lower left hand corner) that it has not been reviewed by the Colorado Dept. of Education or its licensing dept... basically it has nothing to do with Colorado nor does it have any credibility! AND the kicker is that 40 of the 125 questions in the back are about FLORIDA and the guidelines there. ALSO - the questions are based on the 1988 version of Information Power... talking about overhead projectors and how many square feet there should be for certain calculations, etc.The book is a hoax and a waste of money. I took the PLACE test last weekend and this book did not pertain or help me at all."
2,"Ricky Martin continues to amaze me with his talent.I've been a fan of his since he was like 10 years old and used to sing with Menudo back home in Puerto Rico. Not only is he sexy, a good actor, but he is an even better singer. He got it going on, there's no denieing it. I'm very proud of my fellow puertorican who is blowing up the spot everywhere he goes. I recomend his music to anybody even if you don't master the spanish language or english for that matter. I think his voice and his music can be liked by americans, hispanics, and foreigners alike. I don't just give his music 5 stars I give him a perfect 10, and some platinum to go with it! I LOVE YOU RICKY!"
2,"And I am a person who can rarely watch a movie twice. My friends and I can quote exact lines from the movie at the slightest prompting. The dialogue is at once intensely heart wrenching and side splittingly hilarious. Also, this is probably the only major motion picture ever made without a single female character, not even an extra. Imagine that."
2,"About the only thing this video did not do for me, was to take me fishing with them.I have recently been bitten by the Centerpin bug, after telling my wife just a few months earlier, ""Boy, am I glad I am not interested in centerpin fishing."" Fatal last words.The video covers technique, gear and some of the theory behind it. Excellent information for anyone looking into this style of fishing."
2,"It doesn't surprise me that this album is out of print. When it first came out, despite rave reviews across the board, it went nowhere. That's really a shame as it was one of the best albums of 1982 and deserved more attention.Paul was languishing in Squeeze and, I guess, felt he could do better so he hooked up with Nick Lowe and they ended up producing a real gem. As the previous reviewer states, if you like Nick Lowe or Rockpile this is something you'll love. In fact, the first six songs (originally side one) are uniformly excellent, not a bad one in the bunch.Lowe and Carrack had planned to take turns playing / producing albums as Lowe had previously done with Dave Edmunds, though Carrack played on many future Lowe albums this back and forth did not come to pass. Which is another shame, the eighties could have used more albums like Sububan Voodoo, forgotten or not."
2,"This show is the reason that Criminal Minds is so good now. I love the Jack 'o' all trades character and how that has spanned 3 seasons. I love the characters, most of all Samantha."
1,"I love true crime and I have read many. This was one of the worst books I have ever read. Some of the situations are so ridiculously portrayed, you know they are exaggerated, if at all true. Every character fits into overused fictionalized story stereotypes. Imagine the worst Lifetime TV Movie, and it would be worse than that. To top it off, there are several descriptions of these two people, whom no one would want to imagine naked, in intimate moments described in typical romance-novel fashion. The bonus is the ""love"" poem, written by the victim, sounding more like the prose of a third grader. Such a waste of what could have been an interesting story."
2,"I purchased these to replace a set of Yamaha speakers I had for several years. Based on my use of other Logitech products I decided to try these. They are excellent , provide great sound for limited space and are solid. Well built with metal mesh grill inserts and heavy duty volume and tone switches. Headphone jack and external jack as well. For the price you can't beat these."
2,"These lights are so cool. I love the colors and I use them everynight in the living room as a night light for my older dog, so that she can see when she gets up in the middle of the night. It's good for me too. They are perfect for what I was looking for."
2,"Sit! Stay! has become one of my favorite music collections. Lead vocals, Rich Currier and Gary German, seem to belong together - they blend so well that it's hard to believe that the sound isn't produced from one singer.""Colorado Sky"" is clearly the strongest track but ""Tres Hombres, Dos Equis y Una Paloma"" and ""Phantom Canyon Road"" are so strong, it's hard not to consider them as the album flagship.These ""Bad Dogs"" should definitely get their own dog run!"
2,"This was a great children's book. Good book for young children, and children up to preteen . Good for them to read by them selves or to be read to them."
1,"I ordered this lens from RitzCamera just a few months ago. However it's already in the Nikon shop for repair:Status: In Shop 10/12/2007Code: 2159Serial No: 2717591Description: Service Repair Rank B2CAT: B2 (Moderate Repair : Major Parts Replaced).Problem: .TO GWO; .LENS IS NOT TURNING, CHECK THE MOTOR.For the price, I would expect much better quality."

2,I have been reading Esquire at the library so I ordered a subscription when the price was right. Well written articles. Certainly more sophisticated than Maxim which appeals to a different clientel. Nice reading material when the days are bitterly cold and there is nowhere to go.
1,"I'm sure the story is great as evidenced by the numerous 5 star reviews, and the fact that they made a pretty great movie based on this book. As for myself, I couldn't get beyond the writing style. I gave up before I even finished the first chapter because I couldn't tell what was going on, or to who.If you're one who can get beyond the writing style, I'm sure it's a great book, but for me it was a waste of the $2 or so I spent to download it."
2,This album is unbelievably fantastic!!!! RISE is one of the most inspirational songs of all time - I LOVE IT! U GONNA BE ALRIGHT is so uplifting that you can't help but smile! This album is a must have in anyone's CD collection!
2,A great product and the same as Best buy sells at a fraction of the price. Probably made it the same factory with a different lable
2,"It was absolutely worth the price of this CD to find out that my favorite Split Enz song of all time, ""Take A Walk,"" is also quite obviously Eddie Vedder's! His live version here does not eclipse Neil Finn's original, but it's very apparent he's thrilled to be singing it (with Finn on harmony vocal). Who knew Vedder had such excellent taste? I thought he was obsessed with Pete Townshend!"
2,"Janis is the best at what she did and its nice to hear again with Big Brother. I actually like ""Live at Winterland"" better than ""In Concert"" because it sounds like one show and the inside packaging is great for collectors. ""Light Is Faster Than Sound"", a song I never much liked in the past, comes out great in a long extended jam on this cd. Joplin's influence can be heard today in singers like Melissa Etheridge, Joan Osborne and Karen Lawrence of Blue By Nature."
1,"This is one of the most over rated books of the year. I could not get past the first 50 pages without falling asleep. The history of great ideas can be wonderful, but this book totally fails to bring the people, places and thoughts alive."
2,I bought this new release for my seven year old. She loves the buddies! And she loves this movie also.
1,"What a poorly designed device. The plunger makes it virtually impossible to rinse lettuce thoroughly, then it leaves the lettuce too wet after spinning. To top it off the spinning mechanism stripped after the third or fourth use. This thing is such total garbage that it's hard to believe it's made by KitchenAid."
2,It's a fun idea and my sister loves it! We will definitely be using this for our next Drink n' Draw!
2,"I have read nearly all of Morrell's books and I can't put them down, especially this one. For Morrell to get a totally hyper person like me to sit down and read this book through and not want to put it down at supper (I never skip spaghetti), it had to be good and it was.The downside to the book, I missed spaghetti. I warn you never, I mean never read this near dinner when it is your favorite food, you'll go to bed hungry."
1,"You have to know Latin grammar to use this dictionary. Perfectly simple words like 'dans' and 'ejus' are not included -- you have to know what the roots are to look them up. A good introduction to grammar is included, but for those that do not want to take the time to brush up it would be MUCH more useful if all word forms were included with cross-reference to the roots."
1,"This book remindes me of a movie script that didn't make it to be a movie. Half the book goes into the background of the characters wich is interesting, although hardly believable. The other half just leaves you hanging with a pathetic ending. It is almost as if the writer decided he was tired of writing and quickly finished. I can not believe this made a best seller list."
1,"My first black and color cartridge was fine and worked okay (did run out of ink slightly faster than I anticipated). When I opened the next black cartridge package ink poured out of package and all over my shirt and jeans. The same happened with the next color cartridge. I have seen better deals, but I figured you get what you pay for. Not in this case. It cost me the price of this product and two pairs of jeans and two shirts. Not really worth it."
2,"I liked this book when I was in elementary school. It's great for kids who like spooky mysteries. Laura and Bill are visiting their uncle, who is the caretaker of a large hotel in New Hampshire. The hotel is closed for the winter because it is too old and poorly-insulated to heat. The children think that the big, old hotel is fascinating, especially when they begin hearing stories about the ghost of a princess who is said to haunt the hotel and put people under her spell to do her bidding. When the children begin noticing that their uncle is behaving strangely, they start to wonder if he is under the princess's spell. Even though their parents have forbidden them to go inside the old hotel, Laura is determined to investigate the mystery, just like the main character in her favorite series of books."
1,"Gimme a break. What is this? A Brittany Spears album with extra booty flavor? The songs on this album put me to sleep. The only song that I enjoyed was ""Love don't cost a thing"" which I doubt that Senorita Lopez wrote all by herself because to me, her love for puffy was all about putting this amateur album on the market. I lost 20 bucks to the cd store. Hopefully, when Jennifer gets some money off her behind, she can donate it to those poor folks who made the mistake of ever taking up this album off the shelf. I can't sing myself, but I surely know where to draw that line. I think Jenny should stick to acting. I'm quite spent on her lame publicity stunts."
2,My 14yr old son thought it was a great game and he has played many.
1,"Ender's Game is one of the best novels written. Not only is it a purely enjoyable read, but it surrounds and is encapsulated by situations and events that will leave you thinking for months and years afterwards.As good as Ender's Game is, Xenocide is unworthy to follow it. It follows a simplistic premise and frustrating story. Even if you ignore the total lack of scientific developments in the hundreds of years passed since Ender's Game, it's still just a boring, unfortunate followup to a sci-fi classic.The only thing worse than Xenocide is Children of the Mind. Skip them both - if you must know what happens, ask a friend who was unlucky enough to read them both.Card is an excellent writer, and Ender's Game is too good to have been followed up with such a poor second."
1,"this movie is a waist of time.. i think they put Peter Jacksons name on it so they could sell it..the first half is like a documentary with horrid low budget actors.. the aliens who live in the ""shanty"" town are silly... they have elements of ghetto thugs but trying to be cute about it.. then the main character who completely unbelievable becomes half alien and fight the humans.. who are imprisoning the aliens for 2 decades blah blah.. its a steaming pile of crap... save your money and rent it at a red box thing for a dollar.. the only thing good was the last 15 minutes or so.. the action/killing scenes are kinda cool.. just not worth buying to own.. trust me im sorry i did"
1,"This player had good picture quality and sound, however, the unit boke just over a year after purchase. The picture still works but the audio no longer comes through. It is going to cost $150 to repaire and the warranty just ran out. Needless to say I will not purchase a toshiba as my next player."
2,I would say this game is so excellent that even a person who hates Mario games would love it. I recommend it for all ages. Just the thing that makes the game spicy is that at the end of the game you have to go through Bowser's castle and the bar at the bottom of the screen doesnt move. Which means you have to use your thinking cap for the last level. Hope you enjoy the game if you get it. :-)
1,I don't see no difference . What a waste of money ! I really have some scares I want to fade can anyone recommend something better?
2,"Antes que nada, deseo decir que ya estaba informado acerca de la producción de este nuevo album, antes que saliera al mundo, y también me dijeron que éste album sería mejor aún que el exitoso ""Más"". Pero eso último no me lo creí, para todos los que lo hayan escuchado saben que ese es sino el mejor, uno de los mejores albumnes que un artista hispano ha producido, mérito del español... Pero lo que podemos encontrar en este nuevo CD, es algo más interesante. Algo que quizás no sea comercial, pero los que amamos la buena música decimos: Al diablo con la música comercial!! (escucha Ricky Martin), pero lleno de buena música y la calidad que Alejandro sanz nos tiene acostumbrados, sí o no? Uno de las mejrores producciones que he oído, y si es precedida por el ""Más"", qué más se puede pedir?. Disfrútenlo."
1,I received this item and it's not 1-6.The DVD's included with this set is 1-4 and 2 6's/Half Blood Prince's. NO Order of the Phoenix...
2,"This is a heartwarming story, quirky and unforgettable. The acting is exceptionable and the characters odd enough you are never certain what they will do...the story comes out in small pieces and you never know if it is a 'yarn' or 'history' untill the end. It captures the fifties and old men and orphan boys and the chance for a new life with a memorable ending."
2,"Not bad for an album that was composed on an Atari ST back when there were no MP3 or computer music the way we have it now, 808 State plain rock, and this album is well worth adding to your collection!!!"
2,"works great....seems to be hard enough steel to hold up for awhile. one tip...if you can't pry it off try placing the watch on its side, place the blade in the crack, then give it a rap from a screw driver handle...pops right off!"
2,Chevy Chase can get a laugh with just the look on his face. He does so several times throughout this classic movie. One of the things that makes this film so popular is that a lot of us relate to it for two reasons; it a family setting and cross country travel is involved.There's the usual comedic situations Chevy encounters such as getting lost in St. Louis and arriving at Wally World after it's been closed for cleaning. But there's also more. A nice mix exists whereby the comic rhythm is given an ebb and flow as small amounts of romance are inserted periodically.The downside is the treatment of the grandmother. That isn't a funny bit. It distracts from an otherwise very funny movie.
1,"Suze moves from a New York apartment to a northern California mansion and must learn to live with her three stepbrothers and go to a new 300 year old Catholic school. as if that wasn't bad enough, suze encounters two more troublesome ghosts-- one wants to kill her and the other wants to help her. which is worse?This book seems to be more like a sequel than an original--it kept throwing things at you that it expected you to know. that made it confusing to read and you might need to read it twice to understand it, especially at the end. i did not particularly enjoy this book and I expected better from this author. i will recommend most other novels by meg cabot but i was disappointed in this book."
2,"Hellsing may have only 13 (yes its 13, not twelve, I have seen all of them)episodes, but it is still one of the best animes I have ever seen. It kind of reminds me of Trigun for some reason, except minus the comedy part.In my opinion, the whole usage of Vampires as a storyline was set out alot better than Vampire hunter D or any of the other vampire anime movies. Alucard (In the official version his name is spelled Arucard but it really make sense since backwards Arucard is Dracura not Dracula) is just one bad...guy and the fight scenes are really cool. The show has an interesting art style and the frequent use of the color red and black really creates a good image. 3 episodes or not, this is one show you cannot miss."
2,"I purchased this natural-light lightbulb to bring the sunlight indoors and it does just that. I use it to light my room to aid with my studies (I found I'm not straining as hard to read my materials now, so mission accomplished). There is one downside, though. It's heat output. In the winter I get pretty chilly in my room while studying or working on my computer. I have the bulb in my desk lamp and it puts off enough heat to keep me warm without a space heater (I can't even touch the lamp unit once it's been on for two minutes or more). It's ok in the winter, but I'm gonna have to change the bulb out when summer rolls around again or I'll melt."
1,"After hearing the terrific songs ""So Unsexy"" and ""Hands Clean"" on the radio, I rushed out and bought what I hoped would be a smart, energetic, insightful CD. What I discovered instead was Alanis Morrissette basically recycling the same music she used on her ""Jagged Little Pill"" CD. Only this time, her lyrics are more obtuse, less accessible, and less compelling. There are a few bright spots on the CD, such as the songs I mentioned. But, overall, the CD is rather negligible and self-involved. I believe only die-hard fans of Morrissette's will get any real mileage out of this vapid collection. (Ironically enough, I purchased Lisa Loeb's new CD ""Cake & Pie"" the same day I bought this one, and that CD surprised me by being the musically superior to Morrissette's effort. So if you want some great new chick rock, check out that title.)"
2,"This is a one CD sampler of the 3-CD box set called ""Freedom: Songs from the Heart of America [Box Set]"". Don't think you are getting 3 CDs when you buy ""Freedom: A History of US."" I made that mistake when I bought this CD, not knowing there were two versions. Still, the single CD has a number of songs to recommend about it. ""People Get Ready"" by The Impressions, ""I Wish I Knew How to Be Free"" by Nina Simone and ""Because All Men Are Brothers"" by Peter, Paul & Mary with Dave Brubeck are the highlights for me. There are also songs on this CD that I have performed by other artists, and I prefer the versions NOT on this CD. As an example, I much prefer The Byrds' version of ""The Times They Are a Changin'"" (which is not on this CD) to Bob Dylan's version (which is on the CD)."
2,"Dragons, castles, princesses, and sorcerers. Oh my!!! If you like all these things and adventures you should read The Two Princesses of Bamarre by Gail Carson Levine, published by Scholastic Inc.in 2001.This book is about two princesses that live in a castle in Bamarre.Myrel gets the Gray Death and Addie [the scared one] tries to go out and find the cure. On her way she meets all kinds of things like dragons, specters ,and gryphons.An exciting part of the book is towards the end of the book. It's when Addie and some people she met are battling ogres and only one person dies. Throughout the battle Addie was always yelling, ""Victory for Bamarre!"". This book might make you cry. Then when you think that Myrel died, there's a surprise twist!On a scale of 1-10 for the rating of this book I would give it a 9 because it really is a good book. But some of it is confusing."
2,"We've heard Torn, we know she can sing. Thing is she has something I don't heard so often, she sings with PASSION!!! And the lyrics from the songs she's written are great! I wish people would just buy their own copy instead of borrowing mine!"
2,"...this was a big cop out for most the reasons already mentioned in the previous reviews and for a billion others that stem from all the provocative and important things Madonna has and does represent, esp. in her videos. I've seen Erotica and found it silly, and most of the movie clips are only half-video's anyway, but like Immaculate Colelction before it, you can't do Madonna's video work justice unless you put all the big videos in. Leaving out Deeper and Deeper and Justify My Love, as well as the cinematically beautiful I Want You (which contained some of Madonna's best acting to date) is a serious slight. I'd have been willing to pay extra for more, as I'm sure others would as well. Leave it to the corporate gigantor of Time Warner to stumble upon itself in its foolishness yet again. Madonna should buy out TW's share of Maverick, take Guy Oseary and the rest and fly solo as a totally independent record label."
1,"This book started well with Gunny Bass returning to the 34th FIST but it trails off from there. There was very little combat and when there was, it was very sporadic.The dialogue and the innards of the Marine relationships was outstanding as always, but I felt that the perspectives were too diluted. The point of view seemed to come from every single fire team leader, squad leader, platoon leader. It made the whole story, well boring.I would have given it 3 stars but I've also compared it with the other books in the series and that is why I've dropped it down to 2 stars.I will continue to read this book because I feel a major conflict brewing between the 34th FIST and the SKINKS."
2,this paperback is full of great pieces of art by the best Japanese tattoo artist.
2,"I found this book complimented my other books well in learning Tagalog. There are many gramatical explinations and good vocabulary builders. The focus is not pure memorization but to develop your skills in the language and understand how it works. The text is probably better for a more structured learning environment. It is not geared towards the ""Teach yourself"" learner."
2,"If you enjoy reading pre-Revolutionary history, this book will help you get your bearings. Marvelously crafted."
1,"I won't spoil it for those of you who choose to read it but the ending of this book is akin to a murder mystery in which an unknown character is introduced in the last 3 pages and is the killer. Or a novel in which the author ends with ""it was all a dream"". It is nicely written, characters are well developed and it moved me to tears more than once so I feel duped, cheated. What is revealed those last 3 pages make everything that comes before it ridiculous, implausible, impossible. Flock has a real talent with words, I just wish someone had edited her and kept her ""surprise ending"" off. Without it I probably would have given it 4 stars."
1,"Although it may not be immediately evident, the real theme of this book is to discredit rational and logical thought processes by linking them with Hitler via Weininger and Wittgenstein. The idea is that masculinity is essentially evil and leads to all sorts of horrors such as rational and logical thinking, which somehow lead to the Holocaust. This discourse is part of a much larger one in which science is the ultimate bugaboo. This sort of thing goes at least as far back as the Romantics (""ye murder to dissect""), but in this case is mixed in with the idea that gay men and women are on the side of illogic and unreason, and are therefore the good guys in the war against linear thinking of any sort, which is seen as a product of male heterosexuality. In short, this book is nonsense."
1,Bottom line was the levers that you push down to toast the toast (or whatever you are toasting) didn't stay down. : (Had to return it. I should have paid attention to the other reviews. Returned it.
2,"To be perfectly honest, I've spent all of 15 minutes looking at this book in a comic shop less than 20 minutes ago, but I can tell you it's good. Whole stories have been reprinted (photographed from printed comics rather than from original art, but the reproduction is good), as well as individual panels and examples from other aspects of their careers. Each artist is well represented with his best work, and the images are chosen with knowledge and taste. The biographies are well researched, giving an overview of each artist's career arc. I could lay in bed for hours looking at this thing, and I intend to."
2,When I entered the code it gave me an extra year and a month.... What more can be said in a review about this other than I got the extra time on live and it worked! :)
2,Jack Benny is one of the best comedians of the last 150 years. It is very difficult to get his movies nowadays. He would tie this movie into his radio program and now I truly can get the gag.
2,This is the best c.d I have bought since Larynn Hills miseducation c.d. I remember when the guys first came out the album then was good but this is an excellent c.d and it does not get the airplay that it deserves. I'm listening to this c.d. all of the time. My favorite songs are the first 5 songs listed on the c.d.
2,this is an amazing rock album from a solid rock band and that has a lot of potential no question. this album kind of reminds me of the old school queen night at the opera queen every song fits perfectly with what Nikkie sixx is saying in the spoken word sections. get this album you won't regret it.
1,"I am an avid Janet Jackson fan. Love her work ever since CONTROL came out. But I am rather disappointed in her latest effort. Not one song is likeable. What was going through her mind when she chose these songs for her album? I think its time for her to either take a break or enlist new producers and songwriters. Don't get me wrong - I still follow her work and admire her for performing so hard, but lately her last 2 albums (including Damita Jo) were not on the level as her previous ones. She's always been on top and to me she is still one of the best performers out there."
2,I added a couple of drops of this into some witch hazel for an aftershave. Absolutely wonderful! Not overpowering but it doesn't shrink into the background!
1,"Campy, silly horror, stressed story, poor acting, hit-and-miss effects. The not quite camp classic sequel to a camp classic that also is barely worth watching, and certainly not worth owning. Only for die hard fans of the original."
1,I was very disappointed with the nexImage. The barrel was crossed threaded and I could not remove it to insert the Celestron Neximager reducer lens. I called Celestron and they cofirmed that that is a problem with this device. They were to get back to me in a couple of days to resolve the issue. A week went by and no one called. Overall the product shows signs of poor workmanship. I returned the product back to Ace Camera. I am waiting on a refund. I would not recommend this product.
1,"This season is really bad, very disappointed! She hasn't learned a thing in prison and her character is horrible. Sad season ending."
2,I really love this towel bar. It looks light and attractive but is very solid and sturdy once on the wall. I used heavier anchors and screws because I use very thick (heavy) bath sheets rather than normal sized bath towels. It works perfectly.
2,"This movie is fun for the whole family, literally. I watched it with my family and theres not a scene that goes by where your not laughing. It was really fun and i loove the minions! Im so glad Steve Carell decided to voice Gru!"
2,"The Book of Enoch by R. H. Charles is put together by the writings believed to be written by Enoch from the Bible, who walked with God and was not, for God took him. The book explains calendars, times seasons, the fall of the angels, the watchers, and about Noah and the flood."
1,"For some reason I expected the book to be larger,. It was very small. It came in good condition etc but the size surprised me."
2,Quality self powered kvm switch that worked right out of the box. Had tried and returned a Linksys and Netgear switch that would not work with my Dell desktop and Dell laptop docking station. I highly recomend it!
2,The product came quickly and well packed; but the best news is it has a wonderful flavor that compliments my cooking.
1,"My son had RSV 2 times so I had to take his temperature regularly. I thought that this would be a great way to check it all day and throughout the night. It was always several degrees off. I emailed Vicks and they told me I must not be doing it properly. I read, reread and reread the directions and believe me, I did it just right and it did not work. This is a great idea, but not dependable at all."
2,"Tne best one, love the design, I just love everything in it! nice with bussiness look and casual too. it is just perfect!"
2,"I bought this item as a Christmas present for my father. He was very excited to receive it, and started sharpening all his drill bits that morning (not exactly my idea of a good time, but if it's yours, I say go for it!). He seemed very pleased with the quality of the product, so I'd recommend it to other drill enthusiasts out there.My only caution for gift givers is that since it comes from a third-party vendor, it's mailed in the original box (not the plain Amazon box). If you don't want to ruin the surprise, I'd recommend either arranging for someone to intercept it, or sending it to yourself to wrap."
1,"I bought these for reflective feature, for riding my bike at night. The graphics are pretty wild, but they DO NOT REFLECT LIGHT as advertised. I'll keep them just because the bold graphics stand out and at least that will attract some attention and provide a small degree of safety, just not at night."
1,"This movie was all costumes (which were marvelous), and no well-developed plot or convincing acting. I love Christmas movies of all kinds, and was expecting to have my heart warmed at least somewhat, but everything except the costumes was terrible...bad acting, stilted dialogue, inadequate direction, and poor editing. I watched it in slack-jawed dismay...it seems that something could have been made of it, but every line of dialogue, facial expression, ""plot twist"", and lingering shot was misdirected. I was very ready to enjoy this, but was completely unable to."
1,"I've owned this book for about 10 minutes now. I can honestly say that everything that they put in versions 1-3 could have been sumerised MUCH better than the [stuff] that they put in here. If you want better info might I suggest that you do a little bit of google searching for vulnerabilities. You'll get more up to date information, and save yourself [$$$]. I am so [mad] that they could have [put] out such a [bad] peice of literature. You're basically buying the video CD, which ... . The SQL section alone is about 8 months old, and any ISO should know this info already. If you're just starting out, I suggest the 3rd edition. More detailed, and less ... . I hate that I had to write such a bad review of such and anticipated book, but I feel I was forced to."
1,"The device is unusable, the cap does not close properly and it leaks. I bought two of them, same on both. Looking for something else now."
1,"I've been using this mat for a few weeks (everyday) for common floor workouts. Somehow, the foam material developed a huge knot in the middle of the mat right where your tailbone would hit. I gently used and properly stored it, and this kind of quality is unacceptable for this price. The comfort itself would deserve 5 stars; the durability deserves a negative 10."
1,"I read the first 30 or so pages of this book shaking my head and saying ""Yes! Yes! This is my child- now tell me what to do about it!"" I never got to that. The majority of the book is sample forms to be used by teachers in a school setting along with advice to those teachers. The last part- the very shortest part- is for the parents and it, quite frankly, isn't really much help. I wouldn't recomend this book unless you are buying it for your child's teacher. Then it could be worth while."
1,"But not for someone who wants to learn at his own pace.It starts with the Matricial definition of derivatives and assumesa complete knowledge of Matrix Theory.This, at least for me, is neither intuitively nor psychologicallyfriendly. Other math books, which are not even targetted atundergraduates are easier and more fun to follow(e.g. Algebra by B.L. van der WaerdenAlgebra: Volume I)Boring, maybe good for someone at college who has a teacher andneed to pass an exam.If you are a math nerd who can follow books like:TheoremProofCorollaryPropositionProofCorollaryPropositionLemmaProofCorollaryTheoremProofCorollary...[Some Explanatory Text]...TheoremProofCorollaryPropositionProofCorollaryPropositionLemmaProof...[Figure]...Then this is the book for you."
1,"Our daughter received this walker as a gift from her grandparents, without consulting us her parents, first. I would not have chosen this walker. Now 14 months old, she has never voluntarily pushed it around. The songs are annoying, loud (the 2-level volume switch doesn't make much difference) and often begin spontaneously if the walker is left on. The motor on the ABC wheel is sounds like it's grinding and the wheel comes out of place easily, whirring loudly, not spinning, until fixed."
1,"This book is so much less than it could have been. While a lot of the pieces are wonderful, many are uninteresting and unskillful. With 500 photos, SO MUCH has been left out, especially the work of the exceptional ""functional potters"" who may be ubiquitous but many of whom still produce beautiful work. The emphasis in this book is on the decorative piece that goes on a shelf. In addition facing pictures often detract from one another, another statement of poor choices."
2,"As usual, Lawrence is an artist, I won't make a review about his skill.The book came in good shape, stayed this way, no more to ask ;)"
1,"1. Wrong title! There is no teaching here, only some choreography for rather advanced dancers. I highly recommend ""Learn lavish layers with Ansuya"" instead of this video - no matter if you are a total novice or an advanced student.2. Mostly uninteresting combinations.3. The same music is used for all the combinations. It's a good music, but at the end you will be sick of it. And there is NO music while she breaks down her choreography.4. Rania isn't a graceful dancer."
1,"My Own Prison was their best album. Human Clay was also quite good, but had crap like With Arms Wide Open as filler between the good songs (Wrong Way was my favorite). Weathered is, quite simply, Creed confirming their selling-out that they hinted at with WAWO. Crap like ""Stand Here With Me"", ""Hide"" and ""Don't Stop Dancing"" are just that. They ruin the whole album. ""Who's Got My Back"" despite its awful title and overly-drawn-out intro is the standout track. The album cover is laughable, not that that matters. One more thing... good luck with some of the high notes live there Scotty, seeing as you can't even sing the chorus of ""Higher"" live..."
2,"As the title of my review states: ordering was simple; delivery time was excellent! I received via regular USPS mail the CD I ordered so quickly that I didn't even have time to anticipate its arrival. I've always had this kind of service from Amazon, and I know that I'll experience this fast and efficient service in my future orders."
1,"I was very surprised to receive only a set of spinners with my shipment. The photo, which displays dice and game pieces, is false advertising, and very misleading.I am quite unhappy with my purchase. I think I paid too much for a small pack of spinners."
2,"I've probably read 60 books on the women's movement. Most of it is garbage that makes you want to gnash your teeth at the enormous errors being made.This book however puts the movement on a solid footing and is brilliant throughout.I took one star off because every other chapter appears to have been written by Judith Hughes. She is more of an activist than a scholar or a thinker, and seems to want to change things rather than understand them.Midgley is the mighty Minnie Mouse that the women's movement has sought. Finally, someone who can think clearly.I have no idea why this book has been so overlooked. It's one of the greatest books of philosophy ever written, and it's clean and tight and not very long.Read it, or forever remain a stupid dupe of the Maoist juggernaut initiated by SdB."
2,"We have played this game with our family ranging in age from 9-13, adults 40+. We have enjoyed it. The best feature is that it has no ""trivial"" knowledge requirements, therefore it is not threatening to people who are hesitant to play games in mixed groups of people. We played with grandparents, friends of the family and all enjoyed the time together.Players must invent endings for beginning words of wisdom from many different places in the world. My children have invented many strategies for convincing others to vote for their wise sayings to the point of making up words that sound legitimate for specific areas...sneaky little progeny!"
2,"I ordered this picture for my son's nursery. I wanted artwork that would be suitable for the next few years, not just until he was one or two. The colors are vibrant and happy."
1,This is a horrible movie! One of the worst films I have ever seen. The cover art is the only quality thing about this product.
1,I'm unable to use Turbotax due to limitation to number of forms of W2G it allows. The limit is 30. Talked to customer support there and all they told me is to return the software. Now I have to buy the TaxCut (it supports 250 copies of any form) and retype all the information. I strongly advice you not to buy Turbotax - they will do nothing to help you if you hit one of their limitations. They do not care at all that I have been their customer for at least 10 years.
2,"Our dog loves these ducks, he takes them to bed with him and carries them around. He does chew the feet off and they don't last more than a few months (we take them away when he starts to get into the stuffing) but they are not too expensive and last a month or two, worth it for the distraction they provide."
2,"Victoria shines best when she's doing dance moves, and it keeps you engaged so you don't think about how you're exercising. A fun workout."
1,While the book may cover IIS 4.0 in some depth there is no Proxy Server portion to the book as the synopsis states. If you are looking for a book on MS Proxy Server the only available and current book I have found is Microsoft Proxy Server 2 by Kevin Schuler ISBN 1576102599.
2,This story is simple enough for babies-small children to enjoy and the illustration is inspiring.
1,"I have been a fan of the comic book for a long long time. Met Tim Vigil in NYC at a show and he was talking up this movie, i was so ready for something great. Well as usual a comic book movie turns out poorly. There are scenes in this movie like when M ""changes"" his wife Claire, if you ever see this scene it can be sumed up as un-funny,stupid & really does not fit the theme.The costume that Faust wears it the WORST, his pecs look like implants, his masks looks just plain bad. The director did not see what this story was all about. There is a scene when Faust is in the grave that kinda rings of the comic. If you read the comic book you will be searching for small scenes that you remember but they are far and few between. I am still a big fan of the comic, the movie on the other had is a mess. Buy at your own risk. And you can see my copy on EBAY later today."
2,"This is a old, and hard to find at a resonable price book. I am happy with the condition, and very happy with the price I purchased it for."
1,The power cord works fine but I have to use the extension cord because the piece on the adapter broke before I even finished unwrapping it.
1,This book tells that was the family who found this baby. The little baby is with the family for a long time. Until the babys mother comes and takes her away. After a few years the girl and her mother come back to live with the family who found the baby.
1,these girls are hypersexual a big turn on for me since I like menage a trois but my ex girlfriend had this tape back in the day and froggy style was her favorite was'nt for those good bedroom memories I'd pass this on by.
1,"After the fact I now see some folks that sell this same product clarify it will not work with a Blackberry-- this amazon listing does not state that. I received it and it is mono (not stereo) unless you insert it only half way into blackberry and wiggle it. So be careful and confirm your particular phone's compatability with a 2.5/3.5 adapter,"
2,I would buy from this store agian the product came on time as promised and in prefect shape plan on buying more from this store thank you old glory
1,"I bought this shovel and after getting it found I had to reinforce the connection where the shovel meets the blade like so many others have stated. I put three 3/16"" rivets and that seemed to make a little stronger but I wouldn't buy another one......Ames USED to mean quality but I don't know what happened with this design.....DON'T waste your money."
2,"The one-star review is wholly unfair. This is an excellent, engaging, and memorable debut. I suspect the reviewer is expressing the reviewer's own narrow, arch tastes, like someone in 1968 saying ""I really dig the Cream, man; they're heavy. The Beatles . . . they can't even play their instruments; they're worthless. I'm going to talk about how bad the Beatles are for the next half hour. And for another half hour next time I see you. And for another half hour after that."" An opinion. Everyone's entitled, entitled to zero sums and joylessness.A welcome new response to the call, where did it go? Recommended."
1,"only a couple funny lines, if you like chickflicks its just like every other one they are just spitting out of hollywood. mediocre storyline, not worth seeing again. the blond british chick is the best character in the whole movie"
1,"I didn't much enjoy this book. The hero was way to whiney and wordy, and the heroine was waspish - and what is with her infatuation with the dog? Another thing I didn't understand is why the hero kept all the staff at the manor. He should have sent them away. Both the hero and heroine were thoroughly unlikeable."
2,"I thought that this was a great way to start off a great series!!! Massie's character is a bit to mean to Claire, but the end of the book makes you want to read the next book, ""Best Friends for Never"". I would recommend this book to girls between the ages of 12 and 18. It also all depends on the type of personality the reader has. A girl into fashion and drama would totally enjoy this book!"
1,"I have liked all of this series, but this one is the weakest- seems to be a lot of duplications of recipe types (ie 3 or 4 simillar fish recipes..). I still like the resturant overviews and layout tho. This one just seemed stale..(the Southern book is TERRIFIC.)"
1,when i asked for it to be diliverd to a differant address i was told that i will have to wait untill it is returned i am still waiting
1,"The cards are poor quality, the artwork is horrendous, and the game booklet is a tiny little thing. The rules as stated don't make for a balanced game, either!"
2,"I bought this camera when it was a new model and was immediately taken with it. Easy to set up and use, the picture quality was very good. You want High Def? For what? I'm sure most people will only use this camera for video communications. In that vein, it's wonderful. One part of the setup will allow the camera to follow you around as you move about. I found it a bit disconcerting as it keeps moving the image in and out.Sound quality of the microphone is great. I've tried some other webcams...for more money..and they just didn't measure up.I've read the other reviews and find myself asking what the heck these people are talking about. I'm using an 8-year old HP computer with only 2GB of RAM and it works very wellYou get much, much more than your money's worth with this camera but I've found that to be the case with all Logitech products I've purchased"
1,"""The Avengers"" may be the most dreadful film ever released by a major studio. A laughable plotline, an infantile screenpaly, an embarrassing script...this movie has it all. If you did not see it in the theaters, by all means rent it (DON'T buy it, for heaven's sake). Everyone who enjoys movies needs to see this incredible barker. It makes the second half of ""Barton Fink"" seem like best picture material."
1,"i understand where she was coming from and each of the characters problems. i'm only in eighth grade, but i know that this is real life and how people react to different things. however, the characters didn't do anything about their problems. Carson McCullers must have been dumped or something when she wrote this book because it's very depressing. the thing i don't understand is why people would want to read about real life when we already live it. we all know what life is like so what is the point of this book? it took me so long just to read a chapter. i didn't get into it at all. the book just makes you want to commit suicide or something. the only reason i read it was to get a good grade . well, at least i get $10 for getting an A in my stupid english class. u know how they say, ""never judge a book by it's cover,"" well this book is a way more boring than the cover, take my word for it."
1,"Extremely tedious - the author's had some good ideas, but the characterisation is just terrible - not one character that I cared about at all. Disappointing."
1,"Don't waste your money on this poorly written book. Doing a quick search online for ""Paul Is Dead clues"" will unearth everything that's in this book and then some. R. Gary Patterson goes way beyond the beyond to provide ""newer"" clues that don't even make sense in the context of the originals. Be prepared to read this book once and then let it collect dust, or give it away to someone who needs to kill an hour. There are much better resources to give you a Paul Is Dead fix than this book."
2,"It is a great product and lasted a long time. The only real problems i had were that the straps broke off in the wash, it was hard to get out the poo inside it, and the bedding stuck to it. Now, its no as bad as I'm making it sound. I will buy more when i get the chance. Its not one of those products you get and say ""I wasted my money on this garbage?"" its like a notebook: It works well then all of a sudden you run out of space or it rips. I would definitely recommend this product though."
1,"Trashy clothes and trashy music. Yes, they do go together. And I find her voice simply annoying!!! Christina, Christina, Christina--You are NOT Whitney Houston, nor will you ever sing like her. You have the worst singing voice---EVER!!!!Please dye your hair back to its original blonde color! I can't stand it being black! Put on more decent clothes than a stupid nightgown you bought at Victoria's Secret!!!!And for God's Sake, please take out that damn nose ring!!!! You are NOT Janet Jackson!!!!Don't waste your money on this crap!!!! AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL!!!!! SOMEBODY MAKE HER STOP!!!!!Bottom Line: Christina may be beautiful and a great singer no matter what they say, but my words CAN bring her down!!!!"
1,"This indie favorite follows Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder), a quirky, ninja-loving teenager growing up in the far reaches of Idaho. Napoleon's life gets complicated when his shady Uncle Rico (John Gries) shows up, a shy girl (Tina Majorino) starts showing him some attention and his best friend Pedro (Efren Ramirez) decides to run for school president. Nominated for a Grand Jury Prize at Sundance in 2004."
2,"Although this show is very fascinating I find every episode to be almost the same. Starting with Morgan Freeman stating ""when I was a young boy..."" then something he did to get in trouble, or something he witnessed that ruined his fragile eggshell mind. Followed by rhetorical questions and theories, and tons and tons of examples. The examples even have examples. Maybe I just understand this stuff and the show really dumbs it down, but I feel like I wasted money investing in season 3. Which by the way, although not currently available, (I don't have cable and I still had the privilege of watching this before the DVD came out) but I will still probably end up buying it on DVD which is cheaper than I already paid for the electronic proprietary/DRM version on Amazon Unbox."
2,I highly recommend this product. Brings back some good memories and is still fun to listen to. Edition contains a good mix of well-known and lesser well-known tracks. Good music to share with a loved one. Don't forget your lighters!
1,"I was upset to receive a damaged book without a receipt! I like this book, but I am not happy about how it arrived."
1,This is one of the dumbest toys I ever bought for my children. They used it for literally 5 minutes and have not touched it since. The image quality is awful and basically the whole toy is horribly designed. Please avoid this product and don't dissapoint your children.
2,"This book brought the drow to a new perspective for me. Having only recently getting involved with TSR/WotC, I had someone literally push this book into my hands and tell me to read it...And thank GOD they did. Liriel Baenre is an incredible leading character that brings the Drow alive for me. I was never a big Drow fan, but this book had me hook, line and sinker. Now I'm just waiting for the next installment...."
2,"I'll keep it simple. If you like historical romances, buy this one. They don't come any better-- sweet, poignant, steamy, authentic and heart-touching. You won't want to put it down and you'll be eagerly awaiting her next book."
1,"This is the worst product I have ever purchased. My mom watched it on TV and purchased one for her self and one for me. Paid $220 plus $44 in shipping. It is made very cheap. Very cheap plastic and design. For $100 a piece, you would expect it to be made well. It even shot out the outlet we plugged it in. We shipped it to them at our expense and paid close to $70 to ship it back to them to get $220 back. They received it in May and credited our credit card on only one and said the other one was never recived. After numerous call backs they finally gave us the credit back on the other blender. Horrible experience with the product and service.Bullet Express Meal Maker Trio Standard Mixer Food Processor and Juicer in one Amazing MachineDo not buy.....worst purchse and service ever!!"
2,I gave this to my husband and he really enjoyed it.THe book was in good shape and came in a timely manner.Thanks.
2,This an excellent comforter for the price! The down pockets are evenly spaced and plumply filled but the down still moves around a bit between squares and it takes a lot of time to wiggle the down back into the center of the comforter. The feather pillows that came free with this in November took nearly 3 months to arrive. The cover is soft and the comforter is very comfortable.
2,"A great movie for horse-lovers of all ages. The main character, Sonora endures a number of life changing events that to the average person may seem exceptionally dramatic and difficult to overcome. Her strong will to have her dream even when it seemed impossible shows a great example to us all! Vic- tory only comes to those of us who are always willing to try one more time. Overall this video shows us good moral examples. There is no sex or violence to speak of. This is also a true story. It shows our children to have dreams and go after them. Have integrity, faith, hope, love through the bad times as well as the good. Above all, if you want something out of life be willing to work hard for it. Don't let someone else steal your dream!"
2,"The package of porcini arrived on time, and were of great quality.Very fresh, large pieces and very aromatic.Thanks for the service"
2,"I bought this product for my second subwoofer built, the mayor reason was for esthetics. But what I found is that this tube is simply amazing, besides the esthetics, it give you total control of the right port length for the desired tuned frequency, you can start testing with the full factory length and the go down to the calculated length, before glue the ends. The flared ends give better air flow and wave dispersion. The SW built was cube shaped .75 cu ft, down fired 8"" driver with 70 watts amp. I'm really satisfied with the results."
2,"Nothing more to say: good quality, working, easy to install and sized for my needs. I recommend it for everybody."
1,"being the same field for over 30 years, i found the book lacking in real facts.......but an excellent effort for 76.00 dollars"
1,"First of all, this sauce is really bland, which is disappointing since it's supposed to be ""hot"". It's about as spicy as Heinz ketchup, so if that does it for you, you'll be satisfied. I bought a bottle of this and a bottle of Arthur Bryant's (from their website) and ... it's the very same sauce! Close your eyes and you cannot tell which you're tasting - even the bottles are identical except for the labels! At least the Rendezvous was less expensive. If you're looking for a bottle of spicy BBQ sauce I'd recommend Big Bob Gibson's or Willingham's."
2,Cathy Angell has the ability to reach into the truth in each one of us. She is passionate about revealing the individual's beauty. Her book is a treasure filled with love and life.
2,"I especially like the song ""Mighty Clouds of Joy"" and had an album many years ago with that song on it. I am sure it will be one of my selections for my memorial service someday. It's very uplifting!"
1,"Certainly, this is is a good album. Not great. Good. That song you hear on the radio is the best. If you like mellow music, you'll love it. But if yer a rocker, it falls a bit short. I bought it based on the good reviews here. Dumb. Buy ""Spiritual Machines"" by Our Lady Peace. You won't be sorry...It's one of the best albums I've ever heard. Trust me on this one..."
2,This is a book meant to be read out loud. The verse ignites the imagination of young readers and listeners. The story exemplifies how caring and teamwork break down barriers and establish community.
2,"Trying to change the male bastion that is the Catholic Church seems to be an impossible task. And one wonders, why bother? Bongavoglia's book makes it clear why the Church needs to be changed and how women are leading the way. Her stories are of courage, determination, faith and perseverance. They are inspiring. You find yourself routing for these brave women. Bonavoglia brings to light a movement and movements within the Church of which most everyday Catholics are unaware but should be. Having come of age during Vatican II I was happy to know that the fight to bring the Church into the modern world is still being fought. A must read for Catholics and anyone caring about the role of women in the world."
1,"First off, the movie didn't hold up to how I remembered it. But if you're considering buying the DVD, chances are you love the movie. So I am not going to review it. But I was disappointed in the DVD itself. The back cover says ""5.1 Surround"" but there is nothing here. I even got up and put a different DVD in my player to be sure my rear and left and right speakers were working.I didn't expect start of the art sound, but saying ""5.1 Surround"" on the back cover is an total lie! If you have a good quality video version of this movie, the DVD will not be any better."
2,"Pleasantville is more than just a small-town piece of Americana trapped in a time warp that is fixated on the conservatively clean-cut 1950's, it is a small fictional town that finds itself struggling with social issues that are all too real and timeless for those who continue to struggle with their divisive influences. Racism, bigotry, artistic and intellectual censorship, conformity without question or debate, non-conformity with purpose and hope, and the struggle for individuality are all beautifully and sensitively illustrated though filmic metaphors and touching performances in this family film. Whether you are one who has always found comfort and security conforming to the assertive voices and visions of others or know the personal struggle of leaving comfort to secure and assert your own voice and vision in a world that doesn't always agree, this is a poignant film that is highly capable of striking a chord in the hearts of us all."
2,"LIVE BULLET, which is tied with NIGHT MOVES and STRANGER IN TOWN as one of Bob Seger's best albums, is also one of the great live albums of all time. The songs run the gamut from Seger's 60s beginnings up to and including what was then his most recent album, BEAUTIFUL LOSER. The fact that Seger, like virtually every other Midwestern, Southern, and West Coast rocker, advocates efforts to free people unjustly imprisoned in foreign countries, as well as increased funding for law enforcement, make this album an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."
1,"It was terrible. They sent the wrong paper. Apparently, it was mismarked and they did not have the one they showed on website. I had to return it."
1,"This one only lasted 2 years, what a waste of money. We have a 50 year old, made in America one that we plug in when the new one dies. Seems to be no reason to make a quality product when we are forced to buy more."
2,"These videos are great,I first recieved them when I was 3,now I'm older.There are 2 other children that I have past it down to.They both love it,and so does everyone else I know.These videos are great because it keeps the kids bizzy and it teaches them song that even I didn't know.To all those people that are thinking of buying the videos ""Buy Them"" there great."
1,"The game save feature isn't working although I have two memory cards installed. The riding around is making me car sick.This might be more fun for kids who don't yet have a license for the sense of cruising around that it DOES provide. But, for this 50 year old, it is pretty close to torture to play this game. I can appreciate the programming, but the game play isn't for me. Driving around doesn't cut it."
2,"I wa a little hesitant buying anything that involves america idol but I'm glad I did. His CD rocks. Great tracks, great ballads. Reminds me of Nickleback."
1,"And who is the old woman? Edna -- ""Vincent"" -- or her sister?All in all, not much to it, especially as concerns enlightening the viewer about Edna St. Vincent Millay."
1,"I remember when researching the products that there was one with very specific instructions about how to use the product. When this product showed up there were no instructions, nothing, not a hint as to what to do with them. As of this moment, I haven't used them because I'm not sure how to use them."
2,"This book is a wonderful book to read. It's length allows for wonderful character development. Each person is amazingly human with human talents and faults. I've read other MZB books and I thinks this is her highest accomplishment. I'd recommend this for anyone with an interest in sci-fi, Celtic, or Arthurian literature."
1,It is incredible you can ONLY play it with Keyboard and there is no option for a Wheel or Joystick.Do not buy it !!!
1,"I just purchased this product and opened the package. Immediatly I noticed that the connection with the headphones either loses sound altogether, or generates lots of static. Then, I read the other reviews here and notice this problem is sytemic in most other units that were purchased. It's going back tomorrow."
2,"Lynch's musings on his trade as a funeral director in a small Michigan town are sometimes disturbing, sometimes even abrasive: you may not agree with his strongly-stated thoughts on the troubling subjects of death, grief and loss. But the writing is so fine and some of the tales he tells so poignant, so powerful, that it is well worth the risk."
1,"The ""friction"" foam slides after only 6 months. I don't use anything to clean the dash but windex. Poor design."
2,"I've purchased multiples copies of this gem of a book for team leaders in my organization. It's one of the best tools to get conversations started and to get to know people better. Not all of the questions are work place appropriate, but those that aren't are few. The majority are thought-provoking and fun."
1,"I agree completely with M J Edelman's review. He gave it 3 stars; but, despite skillful writing, I can't give it more than 2. I'm a mathematician with a strong background in physics, and very much agree with Edelman that Ferris is simply repeating a lot of what he has absorbed, much without understanding it well. I was led to believe from the Amazon profile of Ferris that he was a scientist -- that's a natural conclusion when he is credentialed as an emeritus professor from U of C Berkeley, who has taught astronomy at 4 universities. But he isn't a scientist at all; he has only a bachelor's degree in journalism."
2,"If you have ever worked in a resteraunt before, then most of the first half or so of this book will be a little boring. There were some helpful hints here and there, but a lot of the broad concepts I already knew. For example, dating co-workers can lead to problems, work fast but don't get careless, etc.The part of this work that was really useful for me was the job descriptions. I did some searching on the Internet and could find a list that is as good as this book. There are listings for every position that I have heard of and there are descriptions of the job conditions and skills required for the job and (most important to me) standard pay."
1,"Simply terrible, I can't believe how much hype this movie is generating. It's not that good. I don't know how many people say that this is the best director ever. Ellen Burstyn does a good job, but she is the one who is carrying the movie, no one else is doing something that can be pointed as good in this movie."
1,"this didnt really work....under a black light, nothing happened. oh well.....but a nice poster...... .... ..... ..... ..... ..... .... ...."
2,"I not only have Vol 1-3 but I pre-ordered Vol 4-6 before they were even released. I wanted to get them as soon as possible. Why you ask? Because these are the all time best videos to learn sign language. As an adult, I have reviewed signs that I learned years ago, and my 2)grandchildren age 5 years & 8 months love watching them. Both are hearing children, but we are learning it as a second language. Because of the format my 5 year old catches on really fast and knows many signs just after watching these video for a few months."
1,"I bought this toy for my child for X-mas thinking it looks awesome in the box! That was until I opened it and there are a million pieces and one paper with a picture of how it should look after you put it together. Terrible! It falls apart if you look at it hard enough. The ""buttons"" you push to make gates open up do not open, you have to mash them to get them to work or pry them open with your hands and then it pulls apart anyways. If you super glue it into place it's fine but for the money I spent on it- not worth it. We have lots of other Imaginext toys that are great, So I do beleive it was just poor construction on this toy. Comes with alot of cool pieces to play with."
1,"Happened to catch this on TV. It is so bad I thought it was a comedy. Truly one of the worst TV movies ever. Music, writing, acting, production value hysterically awful. Can't believe Hugh Grant was ever this bad."
1,"Two great actors... what went wrong?Except for the part when their pills are all mixed up and they have some very funny side-effects, the movie is just plain boring.Nothing is really defined... so you just don't feel it. You don't get to really care about the relationship between the guys, the feelings Dan has for this woman he met, the feelings he has about his kids... everything is just kind of superficial and every separate story has no depth to it.Disappointing. We expected something better."
1,"I'm inclined to say it's the worst VSI I've read. I had to make an earnest effort in the second half of the book to keep from skimming-browsing-leaping pages. And it wasn't worth the effort. The author presents a construct (rational choice), and then props it on a score of rules and conditions that must be met in order for choice to be rational. When reality diverges from the model, it's reality's fault, not the model's. This ultra-theoretical giddiness is applied to gambling, ordering food, and other examples that are not as interesting as the subject would've allowed. A comparison with truly interesting books on related subjects, such as Gladwell's Blink or Bennett's Randomness, leaves this VSI in a bad place.The illustrations are chosen haphazardly, often with nothing but a tangential connection to the text. This all adds up to something more along the lines of the author's extremely personal and debatable take on choice theory, rather than a very short introduction."
2,"I am a Christian CEO in Hong Kong and have written a book review on this book for the Graduate Christian Fellowship a few months back. An excellent reference. Touched on many important and controversial issues including capitalism, bribery in third world, honesty, advertisement and marketing, etc. Presented many primary articles with balanced, provocative opinions from all sides. A book for the serious thinker. NOT FOR NEW CHRISTIAN BELIEVERS NOR FOR NON-BUSINESS PERSON. Only one criticism: the editors' own comments at the end of each chapter is a bit weak; not the same calibre as the 20-30 authors."
1,"At first i was excited to have my own shock pen. I tricked my friends pretty good,but the batteries died after 3 days of use, and eventually the pen just fell apart."
1,Killing mr Griffin by Lois Duncan was kind of boring but it was kind of a good book in a way because it was a mystery sort of book. In some parts of the book it gave things away. In a way the book was sort of confusing because the chapters ended with one thing and started with another.
2,"Perfect to improve my running skills. Balancing, koordination training, and sweating like hell. Chop,chop chop...no standing, very tiny breaks. It's a well done DVD. Amazing!!!!! Even for beginners a very good training."
2,"What a useful thing to have in the kitchen - I can't believe I did without one for so long! The display is nice and clear, and the alarm beeper loud enough to hear from outside the kitchen.Two smallish gripes - firstly you need to keep pressing the set buttons for each minute/second, so if you want 45 minutes you need to press the minute button 45 times, with a beep at each one - slightly irritating! Second, the magnet on the back is just in the center of the timer and not very wide, so while it is strong I have found that if you hit the off button in a cooking panic it falls right off the refrigerator every time!But mostly it's a very useful thing to have, and for the price I shouldn't complain, should I?"
2,"If you like ""Jesus Freak"", you will love ""Welcome to the Freak Show."" dc Talk is at it's best in concert and this cd proves it. It includes some ol' school but much more of their stuff from ""Jesus Freak."" Lots of intensity and amazing vocals for a live performance. dc Talk is the most underated band today. Check this cd out and you will not be dissapointed."
1,"I have owned the 3-2-1 system for 1 yr, 1 month and 1 week. The DVD player had to be replaced after 6 months of occasional use. Last week it failed to operate again, 6 weeks out of warranty. Also, no audio from the cable/sat setting ! The audio from my plasma TV speakers is equally as impressive in my LARGE living room. The AM/FM gives poor quality reception compared to a simple kitchen am/fm under the cabinet! DVD players are not expensive. I was impressed by the demo at the store, with a Bose DVD- at home it left me cold. Like PT Barnum said, 'there is one born every minute' Be smart and avoid this product and shop for a decent dvd/sound system."
1,"I like many speakers that break old paradigms, but Eckhart Tolle is definitely not one of them. Highly overrated and boring as hell. My spouse and I tried to watch this video in where he is in Findhorn, Scotland (thinking there might actually be stuff about the place) and there was NOTHING about Findhorn, Scotland. He just happened to be there when it was filmed at some hall. This video was many hours of him sitting completely still (he sat like a stiff puppet the whole time) with some flowers just plopped on the floor in front of him and no matter how many times we fast-forwarded to get to something ""good"", it never happened. From what I could see, even the audience was inanimate. I hope they didn't pay too much for the multi-hour torture session.Michael Beckwith, Gregg Braden, Louise Hay, and many others are far better than Tolle."
2,This was a good movie and the actors did a wonderful job with an interesting story line. It showed the fragile and self-abusive side of Marilyn.
2,"Overall this Bushnell rangefinder works well. I was surprised and a little disappointed with its size. It is larger than I thought it would be. The last rangefinder I had (Nikon) was small enough to put in my pocket. This one is not. It does, however, do a good job of giving me accurate yardage for all targets on the golf course. I enjoy it very much and recommend it without hesitation."
1,This is by far the worst thing I have ever purchased. The buttons are very confusing and have to be pressed in a certain order just to change between preset stations. You have to press two buttons just to change the volume. I bought this 6 months ago and after changing the batteries twice it still has poor reception and will completely quit working if you leave it on too long (20 minutes max.) Not to mention the clock constantly loses time.
2,"Works very well for screeching car doors or trunk, or any metal-to-metal friction. A little goes a long way, and while the product is good there really should be an applicator tip. The nozzle is blunt and rather broad, so you can either apply it neatly using a tool or try to squeeze out a lump and flick it into the right place. You can guess which method I opted for, but it was effective regardless."
1,"Didn't work as well as expected, overgrowth was bad and still growing after application of brush-b-gon, so I went with a non selective agricultural herbicide instead and that did the trick."
1,"Most movies have plots, character development, action sequences that drive the audience from place to place, but not Contagion. No this was just a look at what might happen in the event of a viral pandemic. So what? Do I need to know which hardware stores to rob in the event that everyone, but me, is sick? Government conspiracies involving none other than Big Pharma, a blogger's greed...you get it all, but a real story. How movies like this get produced is beyond me. So I'll ask again, what was the point of this movie?"
1,"OMIGOSH, how is it possible to hate a person who has had her home taken away erroneously (but I did hate her)? And to hate the 'noble'(lascivious) police officer that comes to her rescue? Even though Kathy lost her home due to ignoring important mail regarding taxes, I found it so difficult to sympathize with her. That creep Lester had NO redeeming qualities; bullying Col. Bahreen while pretending to be an officer was deplorable--Not to mention jumping into bed with the 'poor victim' almost immediately. So, faced with the dilemma of whom to root for--I found myself feeling guilty for supporting Col. Bahreen."
2,"When I purchased this book, I hoped that it would help me improve my SAT score. It has helped my improve my score, but lacked some of the tricks that I had expected to find in it. This book offers a great amount of practice problems and excellent explanations, but it gives very little information about some of the test taking tips that other books give. So, if you're looking for a book that gives you a lot of practice with verbal problems, this books is excellent. However, if you hope to find tricks of the trade in this book, look somewhere else because this book gives very minimal."
1,"If u have sensitive skin like me, dont even try it ! Its the fifth day and i broke out in pimples and hives and it itches uncontrollably. I regret it so much and i just want to give a heads up before u try it!"
1,"My cat hates this mat. The inner ""thermal"" layer is made of some material that makes a high pitched crinkly noise that repels my cat. He won't go near it. It's going back."
2,"I am convinced that this is an honest portrayal of life in music during the early days of Rock. Al Kooper is someone who seems comfortable in his own skin and I admire his honesty. We as fans never really think about all the adjustments necessary for a musician to ""stay in the game"". I can't think of too many musicians gone producer like AL Kooper and I found his journey very compelling.For a guy that could easily be bitter about some of his dealings in the industry, I find his attitude admirable.Slow start (as are most Rock books), but worth a read. Unlike any other musicians book that I have read."
2,"This is a far less detailed work in comparison to other works by Edith Wharton. Yet, the simplicity is refreshing. The book is an excellent introduction to Wharton's work, second only to Ethan Frome. I found the book extremely enjoyable."
2,"The opener works with little force, so just about anyone can use it. The stand is nice and makes it easy to store. The foil opener, which stores in the stand, is not the best I've ever used."
1,"I went looking for this after I saw a clip of it on the TV show ""Web Junk 20"". I can't believe that something this corny would actually get a good review! And 5 stars at that! Before you waste your money, check out the clip of this video on the ""ifilm"" website. BTW, you *will* see mullets. (Oh *helllss* no!) Then go spend your money on a real hip hop video. Or, better yet, go to the club and see how it's really done."
2,"I bought this for my daughter for her birthday and decided to put it together ahead of time. She did not get it for her birthday, she may get it for Christmas. It is extremely flimsy for the price you pay. I called the company about it's problems half way through putting it together. The turrets keep falling off the top but I figure I can fix them with velcro dots. The velcro should help to keep them in place while the elevator is used. (Otherwise you'll be picking them up over and over) I intend to use super glue for the balloon tie downs and the numerous other pieces that keep falling off when barely touched. I'm still testing other things before I decide what to do with this one, it may go back. This all seems quite rediculous but the company knows all of these problems exist so you may want to think twice especially for a 3yr old."
2,"This recording is very exciting, and I especially like the tracks by Prince. It's great to hear those songs on classical guitar. Thanks!"
2,"My two kids, ages 2 and 5, love the projects in this book. They are concrete and completely do-able for preschoolers! What's more, the finished projects look fantastic and colorful and they really made them, instead of doing one small part and me doing all the rest for them."
2,"Ok, this item takes some time to learn to use. The directions don't really help. You have to set it, then place it and experiment. I had the gophers filling it with dirt. I started keeping score: Gophers 6, me 0, then one day I lifted it up and the backside of the biggest gopher (looked like a beaver) was hanging out. It is NOT messy. All you have to do is release the trap and the dead gopher falls out. So, now the score is gopher 6, me 1. I have another gopher who fills the trap but with perseverence, he will be my # 2! Someone told me to stuff the dead gopher body back in the hole so it will decompose and be smelly, therefore driving any other gophers away. I will do that with #2."
1,"I needed more cool aire functionability,,thought since our ac had gone out in our small office this would help until an new or repair had been completed. No.Not really.I was not impressed. but its cooling capacity..."
1,Should have known that black pans are not good for baking! When the minimum bake time is over the part of the cookies in contact with the pan will be too dark... almost appear burnt. Buy a light colored pan even if it doesn't look as pretty.
2,"This book takes you from oral hygiene to ectasy, or i should say your man's ectasy. Very well written instruction manual, very highly recommended."
2,"I am a librarian and I love giving kids this book to use for their experiments. The experiments explain volcanoes and earthquakes in a way that is easy for them to understand. As in all experiment books, some experiment need some adult help while others require household items. The only difficulty I had with this book was the listing of the objects needed to make the experiment. They are listed awkwardly and you need to read the list carefully. (if this kink was worked out, I would have given the book 5 stars! )"
2,"Bose es uno de los artistas españoles que te invitan de manera intima a escuchar su musica, esa invitacion te lleva a un viaje lleno de sorpresas. En este caso, Sereno nos muestra a un Bose dispuesto a rechazar corrientes comerciales y sentar pie sobre lo que el considera una musica mas elaborada sin caer en lo complicado. En Sereno se dan cita la balada romantica ""Puede que"" (colaboracion con A.Sanz), ""Te digo amor"" (quizas una de sus canciones mas personales en ese tema); el pop clasico con sonido moderno ""Gulliver"", ""Tic Tac""; el dance pop ""Sereno"".Tambien nod entrega un matiz de sonidos en ""EL hijo del capitan Nemo"" y el irresistible ""Morena Mia"" (Cafe....)En fin un cd increible, super recomendable ahora que la musica comercial inunda negativamente los oidos."
1,"Overwrought dramatization of the Guadalcanal campaign. The marines all look like actors right out of acting school. There is a droning over voice saying anti war platitudes. Of course, all the women at home are beautiful with not a plump or pimply one among them.Sean Penn is at his worst here.However, there are some well done battle scenes."
1,"I'm not a hardcore Ministry fan, but I have enjoyed a few of their CD's from the past. Sometimes I need to hear something with heavy industrial edge to it, and Ministry does it.I got this CD and I like the music to it. The lyrics however, ruin the album for me. I respect people's political opinions whether I agree with them or not. But this is kind of absurd. Even if I hated Bush, I would still find this type of propaganda annoying, especially in a band that I like to listen to. I'm not a Bush hater, but I'm not a Bush lover either, thats for sure.If you can get past the propaganda lyrics, then its not too bad. The music itself is heavy as hell. I suggest previewing tracks before buying. I would rate the music part of it at 5, but its not enjoyable due to the lyrics. I assume if you dont agree to this review you are a hardcore liberal with no open mind."
1,"Wow, I actually paid money for this! If I have ever purchased a movie and complained about it then this one takes the number one slot! Keep your money in your pocket."
1,"If Paleo people were so fit and healthy why do authors of this book put so much empahsis on importance of sports drinks? How about soda bicarbonate to improve one's performance, or caffeine? So where do we draw the line? Either promote NATURAL way of nourishing our bodies or lets have a list of supplements (as long as they are still legal) to give an athlete the edge. Too bad our ancestors did not have access to energy jels."
1,"Just after one-year warranty expired, top heating element stopped working. Sanyo gave runaround and does not make replacement parts. Oven case in good condition and bottom element still works, but since it no longer toasts or bakes, it will go in trash. I should have read the bottom reviews for this product which describe similar problems."
1,I should have known when I didn't see any mention of this compiliation on Alicia's website that this might be a waste of money and time. It would have been much better if it were strickly an intrumental approach to her songs. Instead it is various people attempting to sound like Alicia. I'm being very generous when I say attempting to sound like her. Don't waste your money on this one.
1,"If you are looking to hear the original tracks, then do not waste your money on this product! Apart from the cover that has the out of shape Sylvester bending over (think Benny Hill) ...... I'll have to use it as a coaster for my tea cup, not much else I can do with it."
1,"This book might be good as a simple review for children interested in kennels. I found it to be very simplistic and filled with a lot of ""common sense"" information. If you are really interested in reading it, check your local library, it is just not worth the money."
2,"Our son just turned 15 a couple of weeks ago, and he asked for juggling clubs for his birthday. He'd already had a little experience with the more traditional juggling balls, and thought he was ready to expand. We wanted something more durable and ""professional"" than the thin plastic, light-weight ""little kid"" type clubs, but certainly didn't want to pay for the expensive professional ones, which are sold individually and cost three times or more as much as this set. He's having a lot of fun with these, and has already been able to work up to juggling all three for a few minutes. He picks them up every single day, usually more than once. If you want a set which will really allow a beginner to learn how to juggle with clubs, but don't want to make a big investment, this set is perfect. So far, we see no reason they won't last a long time."
2,Dave Seaman's mixes are absolutely brilliant. Great track selection and awesome mixing. Ian Ossia is not in the same league but the collection is a must-buy for the Dave Seaman disks. Also check out his superb Renaissance America disk.
2,"Some eye-opening information under the covers of this book,although some info a little bit outdated.Still a good read though."
1,"I have nothing positive to say about this Oats novel. I have enjoyed JCO in the past and this description captivated me. I did not like it from a story telling perspective, from a character development perspective or from the content. Forgive me for not getting too specific - I don't even want to re-think about the story."
1,"Geez! Who let this kid out?! His music is horrible, and he sings songs that he shouldn't even be singing at his age! He's singing about girls and throwing ""wild parties""! He's still really young and his songs are completely not suited for him...although there are a few that you can tell his age by, but it's just a waste of money. He should leave the singing for older bro Nick (of the Backstreet Boys). He also does covers of ""I Want Candy"" and ""Iko Iko"" and as an older person, I prefer the originals that to hear them sound terrible sung by Aaron. His voice hasn't quite matured yet, and he just sounds like the little kid he is, so he should stick to more kiddie songs than songs about girls."
2,"I saw these guys open for Hella too, and I had a blast! Forget the context of ""band"" making ""music""... just enjoy it! It's fun! It's just fun, for goodness sake!"
2,"Fits great in my 12"" paper roll holder. My grandkids can pull out as much paper as they need off the roller. The paper is great to color, paint or write on. Having the paper readily available tends to let them be more creative. I put the holder with the paper on their play table and pull the paper out about 20"" and tape the end with blue painters tape and when they are finished the tape does not stick to their ""masterpiece"" and they can take it home or hang it on my wall."
1,"I purchased this item based on my experience with a similar product of lower capacity from Imation. This product is in no way similar to the previous one or the one described on this page. The rotating and ""push to lock cap"" on the older model was a big plus. This one does not function that way, it just rotates to leave a big gap over the connector, so there is functionally no cap at all! The ""write protect"" slide descibed above and present in the older model is gone. And it is twice as slow as similar products of the same capacity I routinely use. Save your money; this is no bargain at any price."
1,Save your money and invest in other self-help book that is much easier to relate. The author seems to paint a very grimm picture of human relation. Many parts of this book writting were very confusing. I could not help but think book was written as an outlet therapy journal for author herself. There are much better self-help books out there in the market. Check this book out at your local library before investing your money on buying one.
2,"I have had my EVO for over 3 years now (EDC). I work at a boat marina and do property maintenance and this is my most used tool. It opens easy with gloves. I cut rope and twine a 100 times a day, strip and cut wire, and it glides through miles of shrink wrap and fiberglass twine. With heavy use, it holds a edge for a long time. It's thin and narrow so you don't even know its clipped on your pocket yet fits in your hand great! I own all 3 Evos: Evo, Evo tanto, and Evo Jr. All great knifes. You will not regret this knife and its easy on the wallet."
1,"The update is in serious need of updating. It contains a lot of superfluous information. Omit some of the junk and add a little more science and the book would be great. One major error is his discussion on the CFC's (refrigerants), his conclusions about our lives being threatened by the changes to CFC's is blatantly false. Good for a middle schooler but the book is not high school quality."
1,"i tried unsuccessfuly to read this book and could not get into it. America Dream Doll should have been named ""american What""the book was boring, boring, boring. hard to read easy to put down. i love to read novels by african american writers but i will never reccomend this book"
2,"I found this book by accident and thought I'd try it out! Glad that I did. The book was colorful, wonderful ideas and really helped me get my creativity going! Thanks for creating this book for new comers such as myself to follow and gather ideas from."
2,"Call this movie low budget, cheesy, bad acted, childish, anything you want! It simply has a magic that wont let go of me.The soundtrack is expectacular showing off the greatest creative work of QUEEN. This is my most prised DVD of all. Long live Flash!"
2,"I recently made the choice to take my chance on buying this 2 cd set as I did on suffocation and it paid off well.I have always heard of this band but for some strange reason I never really listened to any of their music until now.The first cd is awesome and really reminds me of death's leprosy because it has that same intensity,but only more brutal.The second cd is also really good and also reminds me of death's human album.The songs are brutal but they incorporate more melody and progression.All in all,this is a great purchase that any fan of death metal should own in their collection."
1,"I have almost every Incognito CD and have been lucky enough to catch them live in Cape Town, so I know what they're capable of. Well, at least I THOUGHT I knew. This new album changed that. After getting hold of an advance copy a month early in Japan, I couldn't wait to get it onto my deck. Wasted journey."
1,"Oh for the love of God! She wasflying the helicopter with nails longer than a tree bark and ones that had just been freshly manacured. Her body didn't look like she was exactly a ""lethal weapon"" as the reviews claimed. The dialouge was so stupid(except the bad guys) and The actors stunk!"
2,MAN! IF U HAVENT HEARD IT YET WHAT R U WAITING FOR? THIS GUYS ARE A LOAD OF ENERGY. THEIR SHOWS R THE GREATEST. THEIR IS NOT ONE PERSON STANDING! EVERYBODY SHAKES THIER ASS. THE CD IS AWESOME FROM START TO FINISH. WITH THEIR BLEND OF ALTERNATIVE-HIP HOP-RANCHERA-SALSA- CUMBIA-REGGAE-SKA-BLABLABLA THEY MIX EVERY TYPE OF MUSIC TOGETHER. WHETHER THEY R PLAYING RAP OR LATIN OR WHATEVER U CAN SURELY BET THEY WILL ROCK YOUR ASS!!!!!!!!!!!
1,"This product is such a disappointment. I originally was pleased with the delivery and overall appearance of this product. I have only had it for three months and I didn't even remove it from the package for a month. Once I did, I still did not use it as a throw, I draped it on the back of the couch. This blanket began unraveling the first day out of the package. It is still unraveling as I type. Horrible quality and think you should know what to expect."
1,This is our second Poulan chainsaw. Someone stole my other one last year from the back of my truck when I stopped to get a cup of coffee after cutting down our Christmas Tree. We were heartbroken. I have changed my review because it is the 2nd one that doesn't work after a few months. The repair shop keeps saying the carberator is messed up....we spent extra and got a more expensive brand...can't afford to pay the money and no chain saw after a couple of months....tooo BAD...I love the features and how easy it started. Won't buy another.
1,"this thing does not work for 30 days, not even for 20.it works for about a week, 10 days at most, and after that it starts to smell progressively and becomes unbearable pretty soon. i think it is too expensive to change the carteiges so often. if i new it is going to be like that at the time of purchasing, i would never buy this product. i even tried electric air cleaning systems with it; does not work. with air fresheners it becomes even worse. I would not recommend this product."
2,"I have had this printer for about two weeks now and so far it is an excellent value. Out of the box it was easy to set up, and the drivers were a snap. One caution for W2K users though, drivers for W2K need to be downloaded from the internet. I am not sure why Xerox does it that way, but the drivers do install quite easily.Print quality is great, and you have four levels of detail. I print a monthly tenant newsletter, and I use draft quality to save ink. It printed out 70 copies in about 5 minutes in draft mode!Overall I am impressed with the quality. I will complain that the receiver tray can pop off sometimes during printing. A strange effect indeed. With all the advantages though (I run mine via USB) and an awesome price, I HIGHLY recommend this printer. You will not be dissappointed."
1,"I just got this Philips PHDTV3 antenna. Based on the comments I've seen posted before I knew there was a chance for error, but I thought I'd be on the lucky side. The antenna did nothing better for me than the current rabbit no-power required cheap 1-dollar antenna I had before. I still need to play a little bit with it before I declare it a disaster, so if someone experienced the same and had solved appreciate any suggestion."
1,"I love God Has Not 4Got, my purpose for purchasing the CD. But I was very very disappointed. There are a couple..only a couple songs that I really like. That's When is one and I Have Decided, I love that one almost as much as God Has Not 4Got. I haven't heard his other cd's and I am still debating if I should purchase them. But as someone else has said, it is too Techno and Hip-Hop. When I listen to this cd on my compter (RealOne) the genre is listed as Rap. He definitely has talent, but maybe a little too extreme with this cd. God Bless"
2,"With all the high praise and stellar reviews of this book, what more can be said? A little testimonial: when I first heard about this book I thought ""oh, no, not another book saying more of the same"" but especially after participating in a weekend ""Beyond Belief"" with Arjuna and his partner Pamela, I can only humbly recommend this book as a treasure of insights and simple ""practices"" drawn from the waters of the greatest spiritual teachings. A workbook/study resource guide and a compelling tale of deepening, this is a jewel of a book celebrating life at its most personal and impersonal."
2,I love this book. I think it is fun to read and learn and also full of several different coins that will keep you searching and collecting for years. I think this is a great purchase. My daughter loves putting the coins in the slots.
1,"DO NOT BUY - you will have problems with Innova cookware like everybody else does and Innova will not do anything about it!!!INNOVA SELLS FAULTY COOKWARE DOESN'T HONOR WARRANTY!!!I would give Innova line of cookware 0 stars if I could because there is absolutely nothing positive about it. When I first got this pot it seemed ok. But after enamel started chipping off (very common problem with Innova cookware, as I later discovered), I contacted customer service and all they told me was:""That would not be covered by the warranty because it does not affect the function of the cookware.""One line, no ""sorry"", ""thank you"" or whatever. Not to mention this ridiculous and dirty way to dishonor warranty.DO NOT BUY or you will be giving your money to thiefs!"
2,"-- And it's a ""kids book""!!!I'm 26 now, but I remember the astonishment and awe I first felt borrowing this book from my 5th grade class's ""library"" when I was 10 years old. Back then, I gave up after 4 hours of not being able to figure anything at all out and had to look in the Sooper Sikret Section, but this time around, I got a few more of the clues on my own before having to look up the Section :PA great book to sate the inquisitive mind of a bright child, honestly. Highly recommended!"
1,where is my order if you send my order and i get it before the 8th of august i may change my mind but as of now i will never order from you again and my 300 freinds since i am a truck driver of all 48 and canada not to buy from you
1,"I hated everything.I didn't get one thing i liked and nothing fit.On top of that,I only got 9 pieces.well,it is a random thing so oh well.Wont be buying from them again."
2,"The Fellowship the Ring is the first part of J.R.R Tolkiens epic fantasy trilogy about a hobbit named Frodo Baggins; heir of Bilbo Baggins, hero of the hobbit. In the Hobbit Bilbo finds a magical ring that he takes home with him. Then around fifty years later he gives the ring to his heir Frodo. After sometime he finds out it is the ring that Sauron the evil character of the book wants. If Sauron gets the ring he can rule middle earth how ever he likes. So Frodo must take it to the one place it can be destoyed. But that place is in the center of Sauron's kingdom. So Frodo and a few friends set out on an epic journey to Sauron's kingdom. I would definenetly recommend that you read the Hobbit before you read this book. If you don't you might have trouble understanding the plot of the book, plus the Hobbit is another great Tolkien novel. This book is one of the best I've ever read , and I would recommend it to anyone interested."
2,"Pretty Woman (1990) Richard Gere, Julia Roberts, Ralph Bellamy, Jason Alexander, Laura San Giacomo, Hector Elizondo, Alex-Hyde White, Amy Yasbeck, Larry Miller, D: Garry Marshall. By surprise, this romantic-comedy working from an outdated love formula comes out successful: a suave, solitary businessman and eligible bachelor (Gere) staying in Beverly Hills picks up a Hollywood Boulevard hooker (Roberts) and asks her to accompany him for a week, where he spruces her into a pretty woman and pays her $3,000-what she doesn't expect is to have feelings for him by the end of her stay. Utterly entertaining, charming, and heartfelt Cinderella story (without being sleazy apropos prostitution), and still popular after its release, with a delightful Roberts in a role that built her as a star."
2,I purchased this baby carrier after I purchased the Ergo Baby Organic baby carrier and the Baby Bjorn performs much better. The Baby Bjorn carrier can pull on your neck & lower back if worn too long or while walking uphill so be careful to take breaks or rest periodically.
2,"I bought this lens from Amazon and at first my oder got lost, but they sent another one, in just a one day dilivery. I am very happy with this lens and the way Amazon took care of the problem. The lens takes very clear picture's and great color. Its worth the money !"
2,I found Butterfly to be a fascinating book. Ms. Harvey displays all of her talents as a writer in writing this work of art. Butterfly revolves around powerful women who have a true desire for revenge for those that did them wrong in the past. I think Butterfly is an awesome book and I could not put it down.
2,Nora Roberts is a wonderful writer. Her trilogy's draw you in and keep you wanting more. I'm always looking for a Nora Roberts book I haven't read yet
1,"I wish I hadn't purchased this item. It wass poorly acted, very poorly directed, and the music was so out of place it was distracting."
2,"We're new to astronomy, but I can assure you that this is a needed accessory if you plan on viewing the moon, especially at full phase. This filter lets in 13% of the light, but I can assure you, that the brightness will still astound you. Threads into any 1.25"" eyepiece. Good value, as everything from Orion that I have purchased so far."
1,"Great camera. Great pictures. But -- the storage is terrible! A floppy disk can hold only so many images... AND it'll hold only ONE megapixel image. There are better soloutions out there. CompactFlash cards can hold 64MB of images, at the least. Iomega Clik! for Digital Cameras drives can hold 40MB of imagery. And, floppy disks are expensive. I highly reccomend this for novices, but for serious photographers, stay away!"
2,"If you've ever worried about bio terrorism, reading this will interfere with your sleep. The plot is terrifying in its simplicity and plausability. A page turner that is a must read for anyone who wonders if this could really happen - it can. The author clearly understands the medical underpinnings and has woven his medical knowledge into the plot as well as the psyche of his characters - makes for a very interesting read."
1,"This product had some nice features...lots of sounds, interesting appearance but what ultimately make me return it was the poor radio reception. Waking up to a static/music combination does not cut it. And the controls are a little difficult for someone in the dark. And it helps to have previous NASA experience to program this little devil! Other than that, I like it :)"
1,This Indoor grill is everything but Perfecto. Not enough heating power even in max. Do not expect a grill taste on your food. Wish I had returned it.
2,Ordered this for my daughter ~ Pretty fast delivery and received in good condition. Will add to review once we watch it.
2,"This work is indeed good, but well, I had been out of kundalini practice for a while, and on the first try, I could not finish the routine; It supposes that you have already some base training and quite good stamina. To start a bit more gently, try Rodney Yee."
2,"I recently wrote a review that I was hopeful but disappointed, and I need to change that a little. That review was done after listening to the cd about 3 times. But between the 4th and 5th time, something clicked. it definitely does deserve a listen and the attention of Duran and non-Duran fans out there. Just don't have a mental wishlist for what you want to hear from them - be open when you listen, and I think you'll find that it's really a good album. My apologies to the band for my premature evaluation!"
1,"and I'm waiting.......and waiting......and waiting.......and waitingI'd write a review if I had the damn unit. Right now, its gotta be one star, since I can only imagine (based on other reviews) how nice this puppy is.Latest shipment estimate is end of Feburary. 2 1/2 months delivery time?It could be time to begin to look elsewhere for one of these bad boys."
2,Well written and a lovely read. I would certainly recommend this book to horse and animal lovers.It does tug at the heart but that comes with the love and devotion that animals give.
2,"This product made my nails grow, it didn't take long for them to grow either this is pretty dam amazing"
2,I would recommend to everyone I know to buy the Kindle 2 now!!!! I have been reading more and more. Books that I would never have picked up at the store or the library. I love love love my Kindle!!!!
2,"Great phone except I have 3 issues...1. phone locks up when accessing phone book... takes about 2 minutes to access the phone book... only about 20 entries in it...2. phone resets when attempting to access one particular picture in my out box... cannot access/send or even delete it... T-mobile says its a software issue... my vendor has about 4 weeks backorder for my replacement Amazon)... its only a few days old... :-/3. battery life is poor... after a full charge I got only 6 hours b4 shutdown , no calls were made only 4 pictures were taken and sent... (all lights are disabled) to attempt to improve battery. Also another day after a full charge and 1 hour on with t-mobile customer service phone shut off after about 14 hours...I am awaiting my replacement... outside of my return period... I hope my replacement phone is not corrupted and that the poor battery life is due to the bad software..."
2,"This is one of the best cases I have found for my needs. I was looking for a hard protective case for my new Nano that was easy to use and easy to take the nano out of so I can put it in my arm band for running. The click wheel cover is great and very easy to use. Hard to put in dock cable or accessories and 3rd party headphones with this case on. All in all, a good case."
2,"Osamu Tezuka, Black Jack (ViZ, 1987)Tezuka, who had a medical degree but never practiced medicine, was a natural to create medical-thriller manga. Thus, Black Jack. I was first introduced to Tezuka through Ode to Kirihito, and thus this more traditional manga came as something of a surprise to me; it has the usual episodic feel of manga (not surprisingly, given that they're usually published in installment form in magazines before being collected into single-title books like this one).In this initial installment, we simply meet our main character, Black Jack, a brilliant but disbarred doctor who continues to practice anyway, charging exorbitant fees in order to offset his black-market status. It becomes obvious fairly quickly that there's much more to Black Jack than meets the eye, but that's for later volumes. A fine start to the series. ***"
2,It has been with me for over a year and still looks the way i bought it. Only a few pieces have been misplaced in the move i can honestly say a good purchase early in my marriage.
2,"A GREAT ALBUM FROM ONE OF THE BEST. THE FRENCH ALBUM IS CELINE AT HER BEST (AS ALWAYS). MY FAVORITE SONGS:POUR QUE TU M'AIMES ENCORE, REGARDE-MOI, & JE SAIS PAS.CELINE CAN DO NO WRONG, BLESS HER HEART!"
2,"I read this book and another volume with the same title published by Phaidon together. My suggestion is that read the Phaidon book first, then supplement with this one. Phaidon's book catpures the core of Ban's architectural identity and is well-organized by the building materials he used in the projects (paper, wood, bamboo, prefab, and skin). The text in that book is also technical, detail, and informative.Though there are quite a few overlaps between these two books, this book includes more projects than the Phaidon volume. For example, it presents Ban's early works (emphasizing the use of walls), his exhibition installations (from which he got the inspiration of paper architecture), and more furniture house projects.If I can only buy one book, I will definitely choose the Phaidon book and get a copy of this book from the library."
1,"From the phony copyright date (1999?) to the rotten photos, I think this is a fine way for the author to clear out her unused newspaper article scribbles and rip-off those yearning for a book on this topic. But don't buy this one. It's outdated and poorly organized resulting in a scattered display of interesting examples but not an authentic testimony on Web success. AND DON'T SELL ME A BOOK IN OCT. 1998 (ON A RAPIDLY EVOLVING TOPIC) AND HAVE IT'S COPYRIGHT DATE SHOW 1999!!! ... a phony way to make the book appear current thru next year. Stay away from this one."
2,This book explains both sides of fluoridation. Really makes you think about what's been going on in the US for over 60 years. Too bad the proponents of fluoridation think nothing is wrong with adding a hazardous waste acid to our water supply systems. I highly recommend reading this book.
2,"Solid fun. 3 year old is too young, but learning. 5 year old won't get off the toy. Excellent for 4+ year old children."
1,"Rush in Rio musically is not bad....BUT....the vocals on this release are terrible!!I trust this release was trying to mirror a ""bootleg"" release,but it fails when you can buy ""LIVE RUSH"" c d's that are far above the quality of this attempt."
2,"I had been looking for a lot of his music and hadn't found one that had very many of my faviorites on it, until now! You either like Ray Stevens or you don't and I happen to be one who thoroughly enjoys his comedy! There are a few songs missing from his collection, but over all, it's a pretty great collection!"
1,I went to three different places and they always sent me the wrong mother board. It also took forever to reimburse me every time. Basically the sweet p4s800de cannot be bought anywhere.
1,"Great to have women led Western, too bad its horrible. The acting is bad without being bad enough to be campy...well almost. You would think they would show the main actors how to hold a gun at least."
1,"1. Not all Dominants and/or tops are male2. Not all submissives and/or bottoms are female3. If you title your book 101 you need to cover all the 101 basics and make it clear to the reader that there is a LOT more to BDSM than just tying up your bottom/sub to have sex with ""her""4. It took me three tries to get through reading this book because I found his view point to be so utterly frustrating, close-minded and male-dom centric.5. Because of books titled like this that people read for the first time with good intentions not knowing any better many of us in the community spend YEARS trying to undo the damage, or just avoiding schmucks that books like this have given the wrong impression to.6. Let me repeat point #2 in a different way as many new male doms reading this book seem to be confused. NOT ALL WOMEN ARE SUBMISSIVE OR YOUR BOTTOM. Do NOT try to top us because you think it is our gender role."
2,"I think that the reviews of this book are indicative of a typical problem of books of this type. The publishers take a book on a certain aspect of woodworking and pad it out with a lot of superfluous ""basic woodworking"" type filler, making it appear to the casual observer as if it is a detailed ""how to"" book. Buried within this padded and filled book is a good overview of English style gates and doors, with descriptions and general construction notes. So, if that is what you're looking for, you'll like the book. But you do need to have the required carpentry skills before you approach the text. As is so often the case in the woodworking press, the authors were undermined by the clueless publisher."
2,"This is a dark, atmospheric film about illegal immigrants who become entangled in the weird goings-on taking place in the hotel where they work. The film begins slowly and allows the viewer to discover the secrets along with the actors as they discover they are in over their heads. An edge of your seat finale has a wonderful twist. Superb acting and an unusual story make this film a winner."
2,"I bought this CD a few months ago based solely on reviews - never heard the music before (except ""Love will Tear Us Apart"") - that they were supposed to sound alot like New Order. After the first listen I determined yeah, they do sound a little like New Order - except better and immediatley became my ""most treasured"" CD. These guys were so far ahead of thier time (probably the only reason they never got any recognition in 1978-1980) the material still sounds fresher than 90% of the stuff released in the past 4 years. I haven't heard any of their other CDs yet, and wonder how ""Closer"" and ""Unknown Pleasures"" stacks up musically to ""Substance"". We'll see ..."
1,The book starts with a sad story of how sick the author was until he found a Ki master who turned his life around. This seems to be a standard story in these types of books. Fromm them follows this with a variety of odd exercises and techniques which don't work. Even if you believe that this stuff works the idea that you would just buy this rather slim book and then be able to heal yourself and others is ridiculous. I don't know why the other reviewers rated this book so highly unless they have something to lose by telling the truth.
2,"I can't believe it's the year 2003 and people are still complaining that Suicide Machines self titled record wasn't ska punk. ska punk?!?! Who still listens to ska punk?!?! Get with it, it's the suicide machines self titled record! It's a classic! THeir best probably (I do agree destruction by definition is in close competition), and if you enjoy good music with lots of great hooks , then throw away your bland old pennywise records or your bargain-bin-bound new found glory cds and pick this one up. Other recommendations if you like catchy punky music: Soft boys: underwater moonlight. Any greatest hits record by The Jam. The Shoes: Black Vinyl Shoes."
2,I read this book in one day. It is a real tearjearker and will make you put your life in prespective...a definite read!! AMAZING! BEAUTIFUL!!
1,"I was so disappointed in this book. I did not even finish the book. No character was interesting enough. I didn't care what happened to any of them. The Secret Life of Bees ranks in my top 10 favorite books, this one doesn't seem to come from the same author. Don't bother."
1,"It might not be a bad movie but the start is so slow that you're bored out of your mind before anything funny happens, and when it does you're not in the mood for it anyway."
2,I think this F-zero is better than the one for SNES because this one u have tons of more cars than the SNES one. oh yeah in death race I beat it in 49 seconds.
1,"Poor little Missy. Even the title is distorted: don't you actually have to PASS training in order to BE a fighter pilot? As for making history, she made it, and all of it bad for women in the military. This story didn't play in the Department of Defense (or Congress) and I guess everyone was in on the conspiracy. Now she's peddling her story to the public. Funny that plenty of women are fighter pilots today and were before Ms. Cummings, so why not Missy? Could it be lack of skill? Since she slams the investigation by the Inspector General, get the true story and ask the Navy IG for the Cummings investigation under the freedom of information act open to all Americans. You decide what's true."
1,"I have seen all Corey haim movies, and this one by far is the worst thing he ever could have done. Failed humor and failed acting make this a fifteen minute watch(before you throw the tape out the window) I recommend not even bothering to rent this movie. Obviously one of the lowest budget movies in history."
2,"I like movies like this one, the story of children's lives, I would recommend it to my Grandchildren too. No 4 letter words in it."
1,"I purchased PCMover as part of a new computer. I transferred programs and data according to instructions, but an SQL database did not work properly on the new computer. Not surprising, this is complicated software. However, even though I reversed the original transfer, and the original transfer did not work, they would not let me use the software to transfer from a different computer to the new computer. Laplink seems to think that they can steal with impunity."
2,"It seems that every piece of film from the late 60's, early to mid 70's isbeing dug up and being dumped right to DVD. The worst of them not evenbothering to re-mix the 16 track masters to 5.1 and use the original PCMStereo 2.0 or worse Mono x 2.This is not that. This is a full restoration/qualityenhancement/clean-up??, and all out re-engineer of the audio tracks andthe outcome is wonderful, superb. This is a must for every Who fan andIMHO if it were twice the price at $35, it is easily worth every penny. Itis indeed a true special edition.If companies released enhanced, remastered versions of classics for DVDmedia I would gladly pay twice the price for every one of them over thenormal price of a DVD. Or if every effort is made, but there are stilllimitations, that is O.K., I can live with it. But can't stand the lazymedia change only. Arghh.Enjoy this one! What a treat!"
2,I bought the Leap Pad for my 5 year old this Christmas. She absolutely loves it! She is already learning the states and is recognizing words in the story. This was her favorite present by far. I would highly recommend this toy.
2,"I love that this measure tape is small and has a smooth action. It's very convenient that it has both metric and imperial units. The tape pulls out and rolls back in very smoothly. The lock works just like it should without any issues. The only odd thing is there is no marker at 4ft, instead the number is red at 48"" I'm probably misunderstanding the point of this as I noticed at every 16"" interval the number is red. So at 48"" it's red rather than indicating 4'. Not too big of a deal and I'm sure there's some greater significance for this that I'm not aware of. Overall a great measure tape if you need both metric and imperial in one handy compact measure tape."
1,It doesn't fly as well as they say but it was fun while it lasted - for all of one day. I bought the replacement parts but it didn't help make it work again. You should not buy this!
1,"This coffee press allows large amounts of coffee to pass by the screen. Thecontainer itself is well insulated and keeps the coffee fairly warm. It does notseem to matter what you do to vary the water amount, spin the screen, etc, there are always lots of grounds in the cup."
1,dry predictable and frankly not believable. who lives like this? no one! dry predictable and frankly not believable. who lives like this? no one! dry predictable and frankly not believable. who lives like this? no one!
2,"Easy to install. It comes with the option to not drill into the door, which we did not drill. Our 2 year old hasn't opened the door since installing, so it works. Great quick fix."
1,"I had actually read in some of the reviews that this model cracked. However, I assumed (silly me) that this happened out of misuse of the product. I couldn't have been more wrong. I followed every instruction to the letter. The stone never saw water. I gradually increased the oven temp, rather than heating it quickly. The stone cracked in half the second time I used it. I would definitely not buy this again."
2,"I hope that this film gets released on dvd soon, as it is one of my favorites. Let it be is special because it shows the Beatles in their most un-polished best, Paul teaching the rest of the band the chords to ""Maxwell's silver hammer"" is reason enough to get this movie, also you get to see the break-up of the best band that ever existed, but with all the fighting and snickering going on in the movie, there are times while they are jamming, that you can see that they truly loved each other, and in the deplorable conditions of that studio, they could still create magic."
2,"Watchmen is an entertaining and complex comic collection. It is part mystery(some one is killing retired heroes) and part revised history(what would the world be like with super beings). The book covers around 15-20 years of history. From Vietnam to ""today."" There are great characters and the villain and his motives in the end are quite a surprise."
1,"I got as far as the first episode about Peter where they describe Peter as a man who was partly real, partly fiction.This is a pseudo-academic, pseudo-religious farce created from an unbelieving viewpoint. It doesn't harm my faith, but I'm not going to waste my time on half-truths posing as authority. The ""story"" as it is entitled, is not wholly in accord with the Biblical account of Peter. I don't need some unbeliever holding my hand and deciding for me what is real."
1,"Though this book offers many questions, which is an advantage, it does not clear concise answers to the few questions which it does answer. Furthermore this text has a very poor structure to it, material is all over the place. The only other benefit is the user friendly gretl software."
1,"I bought this product thinking it would be good to use over paper postage labels printed off my laser printer. Apparently using regular shipping tape can throw off the bar code readers USPS, UPS and FedEx use due to the shiny nature of the tape. The idea is that because this tape has a matte finish, the bar code readers can read through it without the reflective interference shiny tape would create. Each time I would try to pull a piece of this tape off it would split down the middle and I'd have an uneven piece of tape. It's also very hard to apply this tape to a label without the tape bubbling up and obscuring the bar code. I figured I must be doing something wrong...3M products are usually of excellent quality. This product, however, is a waste. I threw the full roll away."
2,It is nice to finally find a book that I can relate with. The way Hawke portrays each of his characters makes you fall in a love/hate relationship with them. I thouroughly enjoyed the book and have reread it many times. I can not wait for his other book to come out. I am definately a fan.
2,"This album displays Jimmy's blistering technique. Jimmy takes the standard repertoire and presents it at an increadible pace with clever twists and an impresive technique. Though many of the tunes were performed by Django, the inventor of gypse jazz, Jimmy approaches them from a different angle fusing it with bebop lines and more modern harmonies to create a fresh, new sound. Nice one. Instrumental jazz at its fastest if not its finest."
1,"I bought this toy because the other reviewers stated it ""lasted a while"" for their ""heavy chewer"" dogs. I have a Golden retriever that does like to chew, moreso then any other dog I've owned. However this toy, literally lasted 5 minutes of him playing with it (to be honest it was probably less then 5 minutes of continual use, as he wasn't always chewing on it during that time), before he had the rope ripped apart into shreds.I had to take it from him so he wasn't choking on strands of 10"" long rope pieces. I don't think I can return a chewed up toy, so now after 5 minutes of use I'm out 5$.I've had a few other rope toys that lasted anywhere from a week to a month. The rope on this one is just softer, its not hard, was way too easy for a dog to chew through.Would not recommend."
1,"I don't have a Kindle and don't ever plan on buying one, because, well, books (REAL ONES) are my thing.I thought I might get one for my hubs one day, but now that I've seen all these one star reviews, I don't think I will."
2,I received this 2 days ago and put the bowl right in the freezer and tonight I made the vanilla recipe and it was better and easier than I thought possible. Now I need to get a second bowl...No more store bought Ice cream for me.
2,"I had this book when it first came out, being an avowed Beatle-maniac. His creativity inspired me to pursue writing as a career. John has his own language which will endure. The world lost his creative genius, but his words and drawings live on. A must buy for Lennon-philes everywhere."
1,"it's small, cheap. cons - this fixture need a special bulbs, which hard to find/ and these bulbs are not cheap"
1,"I don't know if it's common with this model or if I just got a bad one. In either case, I returned mine today. On several different movies, the picture and sound would just start to break up. I had it for a week or two. At first, I thought it was the movie - but it continued to happen too many times. I also have an older Panasonic A210 which doesn't have this problem (on the same movies). I'll most likely buy a different one from Amazon.com. They've always offered great service and were very helpful in providing me information to return this item. They even sent the UPS label out to me, pre-paid for the return."
1,"I'm on my third one in three months. Messages intended for one mailbox transfer to another. Lights don't work. Buttons mash down permanently. Piece of caca, this is."
1,"After one year, our Infinity is headed to freecycle. Problems: it clogs on a regular basis, pet hair tool lacks power and suction to be of use, requires frequent cleaning, not easy to put back together after cleaning. After the expense of two professional service visits, I'm tired of wasting my time on this product."
1,"Had purchased a similar sprayer (more expensive) for one of my daughters & she loves it, so bot one (NOT the same sprayer)from this vendor & it never did work well...it leaked badly, fittings were broken...my son-in-law just went to hardware store & purchased parts so they could use it...too bad...won't purchase the ""Bitet Ole"" again! A waste of time & money."
2,It goes without saying this is a classic recording and is mentioned numorous times in articles and reviews comparing other recordings to it. I haven't heard any rumors but it would be fitting if Rhino planned a 20th Anniversary deluxe release - remastered and expanded to 2 discs. Trio definitely qualifies as an obvious choice for a new remastered release. I can only hope it is being kept a secret given the little advance information given out for most Rhino releases - the upcoming Emmylou rarities box set included.
1,"This curry works great, but when I recieved mine, it stunk up the entire living room with a tar/oil smell that was so bad I had to leave it on the back patio for 3 months."
2,"This Band just keeps getting better, and there is none better. Tool is for the thinking person and I imagine most don't get it."
2,"like someone else wrote, it does make a creaking noice when you get on, like you're overloading it, kind of makes you feel like you're putting too much weight on it, but after that, it's ok. I feel it's accurate for an inexpensive scale, about one more pound than the scales at weight watchers."
2,"I admit to being a huge fan of the author, Iris Krasnow. Her writing speaks to the heart of all of us. You will be challenged to love and appreciate what you have and what you had. For better or for worse, YOUR mother is the only one you have. Make it count. No regrets. You will grow as a person and daughter. You will be inspired to become a better mother yourself. Read it now - before it's too late! Iris, this my be your best work to date! Thank you for blessing daughters everywhere!"
1,"This movie is just proof of how a person can manipulate the facts to create the outcome they want.As a resident of Dimock PA I know the people claiming that there water is ruined by fracking.It's a lie! They had problems before any fracking in this area, they used to have parties and lighttheir water on fire! This happens naturally and has nothing to do with fracking.This movie is just one lie after another. Pennsylvania doesn't have one well that's polluted.This author is getting rich on his lies. Watch Fracknation if you want the truth about fracking."
2,Good product that works great on my trimmer. recommend this product to everyone that has a trimmer. Received fast shipment also
2,"One of the best novelists, and one of the best novels, I've read in months. The book could be carried by the well rendered characters alone. Yet, the story itself is infectious from the first page until its conclusion. The self deprecating Vince is flawed and marvelous. It has some a the driest, funniest dialogue you'll ever read. There are so many works of fiction which are marred by one or even two seperate plotlines which drag the story down. In this case, there are none. Every shift, narration, place, time, etc.. is a joy. There is no lull. I'm looking forward to reading The Zero."
2,"I'm Irish and live for some years now in Berlin. On a recent trip to Ireland, I came upon this book in a bookshop. I enjoyed reading it so much, I ordered a copy of it through Amazon to be sent to my eldest son who lives in the USA - I wanted him to read it, but I didn't want to give away my copy.This is a great story. I always enjoy a well written history book, particularly because a good one can take a potentially boring subject (history!) and bring it to life. Monturiol is the Don Quixote of submarines, and I really felt for him and his band of dreamers as he followed the call of his quest.Next step for me is a plan to some day go to Barcelona and see the remains and replica of his submarine.There is a quote I heard somewhere; 'A man's reach must exceed his grasp, or what's a Heaven for'. So is it with Monturiol. But in writing this book, Matthew Stewart never fails his reader.Read the book and enjoy."
2,"Let's see...$5 cheaper than the local retailer AND free shipping...how can you go wrong??? On top of all that, the optional ""ball hitch"" adapter was included in the box...no extra charge!Price and quality were on par with one another. So far as I can see, I got more than my money's worth with this item.I'm a happy camper!!!"
1,"I love industrial, and Skinny Puppy is my favorite band. I love experimental music, noise, etc...including the song ""Download"" by Skinny Puppy. However, I'm sorry to say, this jam with Throbbing Gristle is a bunch of boring racket. Not everything Puppy touches turns to gold. There needs to be more sweeping synths and ambience to break up the static-y parts. It's all about dynamics, and this is nearly 40 minutes of static. Listen for yourself."
1,"Received the item quickly. I work retail and am on my feet all day, but 12,000 to 17,000 steps? Reset to zero and walked up and down the break room counting. At 20 of my steps I checked the product and it was at 38! Guess i will try a more expensive one."
2,This is the second of these I have purchased. They are perfect for trash can storage and for recyclables.This may be purchased from Home Depot for $229.99
2,"Yup, just like I said. There are actually songs in there, sung by the characters, integral to the plot. As I read the lyrics, I was mentally putting a tune to them, but it was a ripoff of a dozen Broadway songs I'd heard. If this book is never reissued by Simon & Schuster, author John Ford ought to get in touch with a competent show tune composer and actually do it as a musical. It would actually draw a fair-sized audience."
1,"The game play was okay, but not the best in the world. Still like Call of Duty World at War the most out for Ps3 and Call of Duty 1 the most for PC."
1,"This cd rom slot style is an alright game just as long as you don't have anything else to play. If you have any others, they would be more interesting than this one. The game has some fun bonus rounds but there are not that many. My advice is to find something else like Reel Deal Slots Nickel Alley."
2,I'm usually not one who reads story but this one had me interested. The lessons brought out in this book can be applied in many aspects of one's life.I would recommend this reading to management trainees persons moving from clerical to supervisory or management positions.
2,The book arrived in fine condition but was received one week exactly after the purchase date. I was expecting a faster return and instead was asked to leave class a few times for not having come prepared.
2,"Robert Redford, as director, did a fine job as did the actors. If we think our justice system today is in need of an overhaul, you will be astounded at the rush to judgement in deciding the guilt by association and the fate of the conspirators involved in the assasination of President Lincoln."
1,"While I don't doubt the author's intentions weren't honestly good, the prescence of society influenced bias is ever present.Just to point out a lone example from the first chapter, ""In general, African American women are more assertive than European American women, and African American men tend to be more communal than White men"".Notice how she cares to use extensive titles for women and African American men, but when she discusses European American males we are merely ""White"" males. So much for an unbiased presentaton :)"
2,"I've been working on this for a while now, and I have to say it's a good little model. some parts are hard to get right and some aren't molded right, But I'm a beginner, and if i can fix it with only a nail, it's not that bad a problem. I would prefer SOME of the pieces are molded in the right colors for you, like the weapons for example, so you don't have to worry about screwing it up. Buy some cutters though, as i said some of the parts aren't molded right..."
1,"Chess. Not much to it. However since i was a first time player to the game, i thought due to other reviews of this game that this would be the game i needed to teach myself how to play. How wrong i was. It's not that this is a BAD game, i guess my complaint is more along the lines of the user interface. I'm pretty well rounded with computers and software, and even i was confused as to how to change games, change boards, difficulty, ect ect.I passed the game along to a few other people, and not to my surprise, they returned the game back to me after about a day reporting the same frustrations that i was having.All in all, i learned to play the old fashioned way, on a real board."
2,I bought it for my mom to read to the grand kids bc she wants to teach them Spanish and she said it was great with a good translation.
1,"I guess it's a phone with a sense of humor--or it's very sensitive, one of the two. The features are nice, but something sticks when I lift the reciever, so it will keep ringing even though the reciever is up. In addition, I think something is wrong with the cord, because if you move slightly during conversations, it will cut out. Voice quality is kind of scratchy, too. Neat features, but if you want neat features to play with on your phone, get a cellphone and play with the endless pleathora of ring tones."
1,"Router setup was fairly easy and it worked like a charm for the first 2-3 months. Then, I began having intermittent wireless connectivity issues (connection would drop or worse, I couldn't connect at all). Issue was definitely with the router.Netgear support (phone and e-mail) was pathetic at best (and costly if you are out of the first 90 days). Their solutions never worked and they never offered to replace the router.In the end, this was a complete waste of money. I decided to purchase the Belkin Pre-N router, which has worked like a charm and has incredible range."
2,"One word... Cool! This album is great! I cannot stress enough how mixed the instrumentation and the melodies all combine to form one harmonious song! Awesome job to Samantha, and my favorite single, Gotta Tell You. This album is mixed and matched with different emotions, and surprises. Some of it is bubble gum pop, which is OK with me, but I'd prefer something with hip hop/R&B mixed with in a little pop."
1,"The top does not fit. Do not waist your money on this product. I would not even give it away, I plan to return it."
2,"Outside of the superb sound that flows from the speakers, their size is the best part! You will not be disappointed with these, there is so much control of the sound in these speakers. The bass module's sound can be controlled by positioning or by changing the level on the speaker itself. Only downside is the price. If you have a ton of room to spare, go for a bigger speaker system that can match the quality at a cheaper price. But if space is an issue at all, id certainly recommend these."
2,"The other reviewers pretty much nailed the pros of this product. Here's a couple things that stood out to me;It has been shown to use only 3 watts on ""silent"" mode. Yes, it's really silent. Heck, even on medium, its quieter than other purifiers on LOW. However, it takes MUCH longer to clean the room on this setting. On auto, it stays on silent mode, unless the air gets dirty.How sensitive is the air sensor? I keep it at the foot of my bed, roughly 7 feet away from me. On low, it detects my burps (and other smells) in a matter of seconds. It then changes settings accordingly.As far as effectiveness, obviously this product is great. For the price, it better be! If you're upgrading from a $50 air cleaner, this will surprise you. With this product, you really get what you pay for.Be wary of keeping it on the 'blue' Ion setting (emits both (+) and (-) ions). Anytime you see the words oxidize and free radicals, stay away."
2,"With David you could hear the pain and anguish in this troubled souls voice everytime he sang a song. After he left the Temptations and started his solo career many thought he would disappear, but David managed to record some good material like ""My Whole World Ended"" and ""Walk Away from Love."" The real find here is the final track, the reunion of David and fellow Temptations' lead Eddie Kendricks (backed by Hall & Oates) live at the Apollo circa the mid 80's. This recording hasn't been available on a domestic CD before. Worth the price of the disc. Get this one today."
1,A gripping story of how the French let down their own Jewish citizens.Movie very convoluted and confusing. The book is much better especially having to read sub titles while trying to keep up with the story line.
2,"Slow read (for me). Too many spy-on-spy-on-spy characters - most of them with totally unpronounceable Russian names. Overly complex spy intrigue. (But that's the way is is in the real world.) Some of our old friends from Red October are there, although sometimes Ramius seems a bit out of character. I'll read it two or three more times to see if I can figure out all the little sub-plots. Hard to make a screenplay out of this one."
2,WOW! What a good movie! Ray & Kevin lovers will be pleasantly surprised. There are no traces of Debra or Carrie here! The movie starts out kind of slow but really picks up by the middle & the ending is awesome. The characters are explored expertly by these two with lots of help from Juliette Lewis & a bang at the end from Burt Reynolds. A good flick for a lazy summer evening on the sofa! Bravo!
2,"heard a song from this album on a digital music channel on our dish TV and knew I needed to get the album. very good stuff, and great to make love to."
2,Great Book! Full of easy to follow patterns and beautiful quilts. I will be using this book for many years to come.
1,"This case is actually quite well designed, it fits the phone snuggly, and is comfortable to wear on the belt - until - the locking mechanism breaks, which took only about one week of daily use. The problem seems to be the rather flimsy plastic pin contraption that locks the case into the belt clip. Once this 2 cent pin breaks, which happened easily and without any abuse, the case is actually worse than useless, because now your new $ 300 phone can simply fall off the belt.My recommendation: Don't buy it now - wait for Samsung to fix this flaw. In the meantime,consider other, third party, cases, but check the beltclip design!Summary: Nice design, badly executed. Disappointing product from one of the leading cellphone manufacturers."
1,"They are bad. Really, really bad. Not bad boys or something like this. Bad musicians, if you want to call 'em that. I think the drummer and the keyboarder are the only guys in the band doing an, well, acceptable job. If you love good music you'll love Rammstein (It's obvious, I'm kidding). My suggestion: buy the album. You can use it as a vomitive, and it will be worth the while, if ya know what I mean."
1,"Could not be more upset. I did not want the stupid computer edits edition. Wish I had known, returning to get a refund. Don't buy if you want the actual original movies, I guess we're all just out of luck."
2,"THIS IS ONE OF THE TOP. TEN. MOVIES. OF. ALL. TIME. !!! It doesn't get better than The Royal Tenenbaums, does it? No complaints here :) This review is done by William's wife, Rona He only paid for it ;)"
2,"I think this is a great book for every level of knitter, especially beginners. I myself am an intermediate knitter and found this book to be very helpful! It gave me new insights on how to cast on, add new balls of yarn, button holes and so much more. I highly recommend it!!"
1,"I bought this product as a gift to my brother. It said it was 97% and was only missing the outter cover but it was in good shape and played. I thought cool because I had a week to return it. I was embrassed when my brother tried to watch it all the disc's skip and the second disc was so badly scratched it didn't even register on the dvd player or x box. Of course the week had already passed so I'm stuck with this very badly damaged copy. Be ware of the company that sold this to me, make sure you check your product within the required time, or it might happen to you"
1,"Why read a book with characters you don't like and a plot that is so absurd that you feel silly actually reading it? When I start a book, I like to finish it, but this one could be put down at any time and you haven't missed a thing. Definitely NOT worth the hype that preceded it. In fact, it is one of the worst books I have read in a long while. Shame on you, Robert Stone!"
2,"When I first heard Relayer, it scared me (A couple of my friends--huge Yes fans--were listening to it in total awe and I was afraid that the world was coming to an end: I had no idea what Yes were, or what was going on). Now that Yes music has grown on me over the years, I'm also a huge Yes fan and hear Relayer in the way that other true fans do also. I hear a very balanced, complex and beautiful masterpiece."
1,"David J Knowles' book of poetry, ""A New World Ordered & Delivered"", is an unsettling look at American life. Written with an ultra-right wing slant, this collection of jingoistic, luddite verse is pedantic and dull, offering little in the way of wit or real insight, despite claims to the contrary. This is the type of thinking that gives free reign to hatred and intolerance, and feeds a growing ignorance among the populace. Mr. Knowles was apparently also offered very little by way of an editor: the book is replete with spelling and grammatical errors, which could either distract from his ""message"", or, more likely, point out just how ill-informed that message is.It is also interesting to note, considering that Mr. Knowles is decidedly ""anti-materialism"", that the asking price for a book which is essentially a laminated 17-page photocopy is... steep... All in all, a very disappointing read."
2,I won't go into much detail with this product. I agree with other buyers. Never give Microsoft your credit card number. They love to do shady things once they get your info.There is no reason to give them your card number. Just buy the card online and you get you get your code within seconds.
1,I hated this book. The title reads Sniper in Vietnam. I think there was maybe 4 accounts of snipers in vietnam. The book goes back to like robin hood and talking about people being shot with arrows. Come on.....arrows. I bought a book about nam not some book on everything else. If you want a book about sniper history then this is the book for you. If not buy something else.
2,"I'm always amazed when I finish reading Alice's Adventures in Wonderland how I feel like I just read the transcript of a dream.Everything is nonsensical, yet it makes sense; it is all completely fantastical, yet it is told so matter-of-fact that you simply must believe that Alice's adventures were nothing less than fact; the characters are so unbelievable, yet they always seem like old friends. The word structure and usage even reads, and in some cases looks, like a dream. You may not always understand why something happens the way it does to poor Alice, but like the unlikely heroine herself, you simply accept it and move on to the next adventure."
2,"While I will admit it did disappoint me, if giving a chance this CD still rises above a lot of the other filth people are putting out these days (Evanesces to name one, even at her worse on this CD Sharon Den Adel still sings circles around Amy Lee (if you could sing in circles anyways)). The Howling was amazing a good start for the CD but then What Have You Done lays the disappointment on thick. I have noticed a lot of people don't like Frozen but personally I think it is a great song. Our Solem Hour is more reminiscent of Silent Force and all in all a good song. Heart Of Everything is also a great song and Cross is also good the rest is very medium to low quality when compared to Silent Force. Most of the time it failed to catch my attention. Still the CD grows on me so maybe one day I will love the CD but never will it surpass the greatness of Silent Force or the beauty of Mother Earth."
1,If you would like to be able to finish your opponent off in brilliant style with a fantsy check mate then this book will teach you backrank and other checkmates to win.I didn't like it very much because it didn't teach me anything else like forks and pins which are the things you need to know to get to a position where you can do the checkmate. This is my disapointment.
1,"As a great fan of Afropop in general, and of the overall Six Degrees-type approach to things, this one looked like a no-brainer. Like the other reviewer, though, I came away disappointed. There is certainly enough African material for Six Degrees-type remixes to last until the next century, and I think such projects are potentially very worthwhile, but the source material used here doesn't seem all that strong. Of course, it's kind of hard to tell because a thick gauze of electronic mush is draped over the whole proceedings. I don't hear anything innovative or inspired here, which is a real shame because the concept has such fantastic and varied possibilities. This one strikes out, but I hope Six Degrees pursues it in the future with the same vigor they've given South American treatments, for example."
2,"With a fast-paced story that would lend itself to Hollywood, Dupree's Crude War provides a revealing glimpse into the worlds of oil shipping and Lloyd's of London. Best of all it gives us Dupree, an educated underachieving New Orleans gentleman trying to make it big. Let's hope we'll see more of Hamilton E. Dupree III from author Charles P. Carriere III."
1,"I was dissapointed with this volume. The pictures are nice, but I thought the stories were edited poorly, making it difficult for young children to understand the story if they were unfamiliar with it without a lot of explanation. Also, the book uses a lot of large words for young children. And, even though I realize many of these are ""love"" stories, they still came across as a little heavy-handed on the romance for my taste."
1,This CD is just a disgrace to punk music. These guys are obviously trying to be the next Blink 182 and it's not working.
1,"Even rubbery-faced Steve Martin can't resurrect this leaky vessel of a film. The storyline is paper-thin, the acting is an abomination, and the humor never shows up. It's at least encouraging to note that when this film was first released, it bombed at the box office, because word-of-mouth killed it. Even taking into consideration the Shakespearean parallel, this film is like a sick animal that refuses to die."
1,"Couldnt finish the book, the fact that the aliens who took over the Earth in 9 minutes, couldnt remember 3 thousand years later that there was a sentient species they defeated to conquer it really didnt make any sense."
1,Poor quality poster that looks like a print of a print. Flimsy packaging used to ship the item so the container was bent which left creases all over the poster. The seller is aware of this as numerous buyers have complained about this problem in the feedback section. The seller is does not communicate. I tried to contact them three times through email and a phone call...no luck.
1,Only worked one day after she got it for Christmas. Waste of time and money. Charged it before Christmas day. She rode it that afternoon. will not recharge or work at all now.
2,This comedy was hilarious from start to end. I rented this movie and I watched it about 4 times before I returned it. It's worth watching. You will laugh your head off. Awesome!
1,"There is about as much information in this 'book' as is on a badly researched Katie Holmes website. It has all of the obvious information that you probably already know. It is a mere 32 pages of large font and about 6 black and white photos. I could have written more and published a better book than this! Rather get ""Katie Holmes Scene""."
2,"My husband, a lifelong Red Sox fan, really likes this video. He gets to relive those glorious 4 days (and not have to stay up until 1:00 am to do it!)"
2,"I enjoyed this movie a lot. Humor, romance, depth and some great eye candy!And it has Jay Brannan! Loved him in Shortbus and love his new album even more! Such a cutie."
1,"Sprayer are high quality, but SP would not take care of wand, that new out of the box, had a bad seat, causing it to leak constantly. I still can't believe they wouldn't replace it. I buy Chapin from now on!"
2,"I bought these clippers to use on my Persian-Chinchilla cat. She is a long-haired beauty, but gets matted very easily. I tried taking her to a professional groomers to be groomed, but they ran after me in the parking lot right after I dropped her off because they said she was too frantic to sit still!So, I thought, ok, I will enlist my husband's help and trim her myself. We are SO not cat groomers by any means. We used a pretty short blade on her and it worked wonderfully. It took the two of us to hold her down but in the end she got a beautiful trim.I noticed the clippers get a little hot after awhile, only on the on/off button where you hold it with your hand. But in all fairness, I think we took an hour to trim our cat so maybe we overused the clippers past their normal timeframe. I'm happy we got these clippers and now our Persian cat can look trim all the time."
1,"Great graphics, but the in game options really made the experience weak. The arcade version (the only level I could even begin to handle)was still quite difficult in terms of driving physics (simulator mode being nearly impossible), and had very limited play options, i.e. not allowing a race against a full field of cars. WHY NOT??? That's lame!Since I don't have hundreds of hours to study racing like an engineer, and even more hundreds of hours to spend playing a stupid game, I much prefer the arcade like action of the Need for Speed series. If you are accustomed to that type of game play, DO NOT BUY THIS."
1,"I loved this router until I got an Iphone. There was some sort of glitch: it would not work with the Iphone. I searched through on-line sources for the answer without coming up with a good one. I spent hours on the phone with people at Dlink. Finally after repeated calls, a technician at DLink got it to work. I would have preferred if it worked immediately--I really can't afford to spend that much time working on this problem. But, overall, the DLink has been good--fast connection for my Laptop, and now for the Iphone.D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Wireless Router"
2,A nice one about the Siberian Tiger. It tells about the endangered tigers of Siberia and the efforts to save them. The videography is very good and all in all it is an interesting and educative movie for wildlife lovers.
2,"Star Trek - Voyager didn't live up to its potential, but, on rare occasions, it struck a chord that rang all the way back to the Alpha Quadrant. Early on, the series was bogged down with the idea of getting home (a destination presumably 70 years away), but EYE OF THE NEEDLE quickly explored the prospect of wormhole technology and temporal mechanics. A stand-out episode, this should've been the prototype for any 'longing about home' episodes to follow. Sadly, it was forgotten."
2,"This album is worth it for ""All She Could Ask For,"" if nothing else. That song is so beautifully haunting...it's nearly perfect."
1,"I can't imagine many people buying this book in the first place, but I purchased it to help with a project I'm working on. I was quite excited to see that there was a new edition of Thomas Carew's poems on the market. There's a very well done collection of cavalier verse that was recently put out. It's a Norton Critical Edition entitled Ben Jonson and the Cavalier Poets, released in 1974 that has a great selection. This book, however, is merely a reprint of an edition printed in 1899. Nowhere in the Amazon description of the book does it mention this, which I find downright scandalous. Scholars take their books seriously, and if the edition in question is a reprint, especially a reprint of a 100 year old book that is most certianly outdated, it should be noted somewhere on the page. I am severly disappointed. I doubt anyone at Amazon will come across this review, but I hope if they do that they address this, because it is a serious issue that could be easily remedied."
1,"I can't understand why Intuit just doesn't port over the current windows versions? THis offering is horrendous, and the new replacement doesn't seem to be much better (per discussions left by beta testers.) Would be nice to see a decent financial product appear for Mac."
2,this stuff is amazing and you won't be disappointed! yes its a little expensive but if you have dry hair in need of a big boost it is SOO WORTH IT
1,I received two of these shirts of the same size. Both were too small for the indicated size and were incorrectly cut.Avoid.
2,"Wonderful for my dog to protect him from the crazy hunters that surround our 110 acre farm, he is a very large dog and it fits him perfectly and doesn't obstruct his tinkle :)"
2,Great movie!! Kind of cheesy but a good movie to watch any day. Would highly recommend for one of those days you have nothing else to do
2,"ok, ok...so it's not Oscar caliber...but still...it's worth a watch. It's campy, light & frivolous...FANTASTIC!!! It's one of those movies that's so bad it's positively brilliant! Not to mention some good tunes by Toni Basil & Thomas Dolby...& the only vampire rap I know of!"
2,I use it once a week and I see improvements in the way my face feels. I like using the Conair Sauna rather then doing the ol' way of warming up water since I can control the level of temperature and avoid to have the skin burned.It's a nice thing to have for the facial routine.
2,"Because they are so amazing, I just saw them in Denver, they will just detract from how profoundly powerful this album is. This album is one of my top five from last year. You have to buy and listen to it very loud and preferrably with headphones. They are intricate and clever and if ""Autumn into Summer"" doesn't drive you crazy, in a good way, you're wrong and you don't deserve them. They remind me of so many other great bands that are avoiding lyrics and concentrating on their instrumentation. Only they are much heavier. If you like Mogwai, before they got mediocre; if you like Constellation Records' bands without any electronics and much fiercer; you will love this band. Oh, and if you do see them, don't say I didn't warn you."
2,"I liked the video. The instruction was really good and fairly easy to follow. I found watching the practitioners inspiring. It definitely gave me a good workout. It was challenging; a little too challenging. It was a long session. For me it was too long but I'm a beginner. I can see someone who has been doing yoga some time enjoying the hour and fifteen minutes of yoga.My only real criticism is that the DVD is not broken up into scenes. While I was going through the class, my DVD player froze for whatever reason. The only way I could get back to where I left off was to start from the beginning and fast forward.Overall, I'd definitely recommend this video to someone who is at an intermediate or advanced level and wants a challenging, well-guided session. When I'm at that level, I'll most likely use it then."
1,"BAD BOOK! Not necessarily the material (although as previous reviews have correctly noted, it's no 5 star), but I would like to address the 5th Edition, hard back BOOK published by Prentice-Hall. My book has publishing errors & is poorly constructed. For example, Appendix G, which is solutions to select problems, is apparently the answers for an earlier edition - they make no sense. The book's binding is falling apart. I've had to glue mine up in order to hold it together. Now this is a new, $100+, hard back, text book! I contacted the local Prentice-Hall Rep. for my school 3 weeks ago & still no help. Save your $ on this 5th edition, if you have any other options, until Prentice-Hall corrects their quality control publishing problems (& until they ""step up to the plate"" & correct problems when they've goofed!)."
2,"Our family had just been hit with another development in a devastating event which we had been trying to deal with for 10 years when ""Clerks I"" and ""Clerks II"" was delivered to our house. If you just want to decompress, chill out, and think about absolutely nothing ""grown up"", this is the movie for you. An hour and a half of sheer hilarity with some of the best deadpan acting since Charlie Chaplin. A rollicking good time. Part of the beauty of shoestring budget films is that every take must count. And whatever is deleted is just too funny for the world to handle. Thank you, Kevin Smith, for giving us a little while to just be silly."
2,"Carole Klein, whose earlier biography of Aline Bernstein (ALINE) was published to acclaim, has once again written an important book. Well-schooled in the work of Lessing, Klein's latest volume is yet another example of her careful research and writing on what can only be a difficult subject. It is must reading for anyone interested in Doris Lessing, her work, and biography in general."
1,"FYI, this is not the concert of the same title. Just a bunch of blokes talking about how great the band is."
1,How many other child-rearing books have been cited as evidence in murder investigations?*crickets chirping*Yeah... my point.The Pearls are fearmongers and bullies. Don't put a penny in their coffers by buying this piece of trash that is only worth the paper on which it is printed (which would be good for burning in the fireplace in the winter.
1,"I saw this movie at a birthday party, and may I just say that I was extremely shocked and mystified at what on earth Disney was thinking when they showed/created this movie on/for their channel.The song between Sharpay and her BROTHER Ryan, Bop to the Top, is filled with sexual references and double entendres and positively reeks of incest.There is also another similar scene between the male lead and his father in the locker room that I won't even get into.Also, the voices used, not so good. Despite the fact that it isn't even usually the actors singing (why hire leads for a musical that can't sing)the replacement voices are nasal-y and overenhanced. The actor who plays Ryan in the film is the only talented one of the group.I walked away from this movie feeling like it was a bad dream, that's how bizarre and unusual it is."
1,"Is it not important to make history interesting to read? This book is so boring, misdirected and verbose I couldn't finish it. Rather than talk about the issues of the title, Francis spends more time going on and on about what Sewall had for dinner, what he paid for land, his romp through London and wars against Indians.I appreciate the accuracy and thoroughness of his research. But his inability to focus and put words together that are fun to read make this book painful."
1,The printable version of verbatim can't be read by some dvd players. I have panasonic and jvc dvd players and they can't read them. However the xbox dvd player can without a problem.It's the first time I buy this brand. Maybe I'll try the ones without the printable surface.I've always purchased Ritek and never had a problem. I purchased a 50 spindle of ridata 16x and have not had a problem yet on 30 of them yet. I usually burn at no faster than 12x anyways.
1,this software moved over things that it shouldn't have and caused compatability errors!!!it made the CDrom drive disappeari had to undo everything and start over with a flashdriveWASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,This game is the worst game I have ever played. I thoght itwould be a cool game. The moves are too hard to do the game is toohard and worthless. I would give it negative 5 statrs if I could. NWO/WCW REVENGE is the best wrestling game. This game is a waste of money.
2,"I have been following the recommendations of this book for 5 weeks and here are the results so far: 15 pounds lost, more vitality and energy found, and mood definitely better. I am 50 years old and feel the best I have in 20 years (at least)!"
2,"In Open World, Phillippe Legrain (former economics correspondent for the Economist Legrain) maintains that the idea of globalization has been misrepresented - and that it is neither a label for the Americanization of the world, nor a field day for corporations who would dominate world economic systems. So, what is real globalization? Legrain does a very fine job of considering and articulating how world interactions are changing - and in many ways -- for the better."
1,"I bought this CD because it was on sale, and it seemed like a good deal. Honestly, I think the purchase was worth it just for the Sex and the City theme, but every other song on the disc is just a cover, in other words, the original artists are nowhere to be found in the vocal recordings, but I guess thats why they can sell the disc at such a cheap price."
1,"I cannot agree with the other reviewers on this. Back in the days when there were hardly any general texts on topology this may have been good. Nowadays there are at least a dozen such that are far better than this. The printing fonts and layout are spidery and primitive and not easy on the eye. The style is rather formal and dry for a subject as rich as this and little effort is put into illustrating the material with background, diagrams or examples. As I said before there is no shortage of better texts amongst which Hocking & Young is worth special mention."
1,"Typical -you pay extra for an expensive humidifier thinking the quality will justify the extra money. It doesn't. The ""maintenance free unit"" (just a glorified filter) lasts less than a season, even using it only a few hours at night. And the part costs as much as a whole cheap (but equally effective) humidifier with a conventional filter. So much for German quality!"
1,"The book contains inaccurate information, and numerous mistakes. Author's so-called ""rating"" is extremely subjective and speculative. No references or sources of data is given. Misrepresenting of events, exagerating the importance of one fact and diminishing the vitality of another is a typical feature. Definitely not a book worth considering."
1,"I really hate to leave a bad review but this book was just awful. I really love Rollins, his SIGMA novels totally rock. However, this book was just plain dumb.The characters were very thin and very annoying. There was no development of the characters at all, other than there were a couple who were hot after each other, just irritating.The Jurassic Park theme was barely bearable but the characters were just so bad I could not finish it.I am very sorry I wasted my money on this pile."
2,"This novel is classic, it has all the intrigue of of the novel of today. It is fine example of how writing has evolved into what it is today."
2,"""Shadows and Secrets"" picks up where ""Cloaked Mode"" left off and continues to chronicle the espionage adventures of WEB Agents Attewelle and Terry. The book offers more action wrapped into more intriguing plots. The reader is in constant suspense as the cases unfold with surprises at every turn.The travels of the WEB Agents to far away and dangerous lands are eloquently depicted by Raetz's inclusion of native tongue and local customs that fully envelopes the reader. Raetz has also intricately woven the development of the characters as each story builds upon the previous stories, adding a glimpse into the lives of the WEB Agents outside the Bureau.""Shadows and Secrets"" is full of twists and turns with a bit of wit added into the mix."
1,"This engine is cute and seems to be well constructed. It does a good job of going up ramps, is easy to turn on and off, and takes a single battery. However, it kept running off any curves in the train track. We decided to return it and look for something that will stay on our son's track."
1,"Not really a review, I'm sure it's a fine book. The Item is listed on Amazon as being in the English language, but it is in Arabic. Please be aware."
2,"In this book Mr. Hazen presents a comprehensive, interesting, and fair history of the development of synthetic diamond. His treatment of some of the controversial historic elements is even-handed and accurate and he presents complex scientific information in a way that is easy to understand. This book is a must read for anyone interested in high pressure research and a you'll-be-glad-you-did for anyone interested in science at all."
2,I had a book like this one that I had gotten when they first came out. I loved it. I lost mine when our house burned and was so excited to find this one on Amazon.
2,"I do not currently own this book. I borrowed it from the local library. It was on the new book rack. At first it wasn't the kind of book that I thought it would be. But after I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. It made me smile and think about how we let life just happen to us. It reenforces the need to be a part of life and to enjoy life. Because someday I will be elderly and I would regret it if I didn't do something in my life that I enjoyed. I will purchase this book so I will have it to read when I need a reminder that we only live once!"
2,I think the first and second movie is the best. I don't recommend watching in English. You should watch in any other language. Sub titles are better..
2,"This is a very moving an dintelligent book, with some marvellous and memorable lines. The book's first poem, 'Father and Son', brought tears to my eyes, while many of the others, 'History of Doing Nothing' (about laziness), 'Short Life of a Thought' (about what hapens in the mind as a thought takes shape) and 'Belgitude' (about being form Belgium) will stay with me.This is what poetry shoudl be: accessible, articulate, memorable.D. Rodway"
1,"I'm not the biggest Beyonce fan but i do give credit where credit is due.......I honestly must say this CD is the most DISAPPOINTING music she has ever put together. I carefully, listened to the entired CD twice and only came up with only 2 songs that i care for . 1. is of course Deja Vu which is a definite sure winner. anything with Jigga in it has to be top notch. 2. Get me Bodied which has a nice groove to it and has the potential of being released as a single. Unfortunately, thats where i come to a complete hault. Ring the Alarm has some possiblities because of the hot beat....just can't get pass all that screaming. So to sum this CD up is to say sorry Beyonce. Get back into the studio and give us what you've been giving us for years. (That Fire)"
2,"Ellis book is about the founding brothers of the American Revolution- Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, Burr, Hamilton, Franklin. He speaks about the vision of these leaders centering on political democracy and free enterprise capitalism. He speaks about them being 'brothers' that is at the distance that they would be should he have called them 'fathers'. He tells about the most brilliant Hamilton and his fatal duel with the shady Burr. He speaks about Washington's giving up his slaves when his wife died, and Jefferson's justification of Slavery. He points out that they were often rivals, but that they knew how to work together to bring their vision into being. He says that when they signed the declaration the chance that they might prevail against the British Army seemed one in ten- thousand. Ellis stresses the element of contingency and says that what we believe today 'had to be'might never have happened at all."
2,"Better buy it before the liberals take it off the shelf, same with Charlie Brown and Mickey. DVD worked fine and shipper was great"
2,This is my first time waxing my arms i thought why not go for it! I purchased this product and im pleased. I already knew waxing would hurt which mind you it does...However once your all done and you see the results its so awesome. It is a bit messy though and i ran out of strips. The oil that comes with it didn't do much really but i used baby oil to clean up the excess wax off my skin and it worked great!
2,"this book is almost all actoin about a man who is a very strong and kind warrior. he knows that the goodness inside of him can defeat any evil. he uses that knowlage to kill monsters. The book is a little confusing at times, but everything elese is very creative and understandable. I would sugjest this book to 11 year old and up for the concern of some grusome scense. it is only 94 pages, a good lengh for a bed-side book. by the way-beowulf is the guy on the horse not the monster on the cover :)"
1,"I have found many so-called ""spiritual"" books to be biased toward its own philosophies (hinting that theirs is the correct one) and not regarding others as possible paths for the individual, especially the globalization of today.I found this at the local library, I didn't check it out at first, the guy just looks funny. I finally did check it out and read most of it, about 7/8 of it.I had a hard time accepting these weird and silly names like Mahanta, Wah Z, etc., it sounded like a ripoff of Hindu names.Many techniques presented in this book I have experienced myself on my own (no dream masters!) or through a book that I do recommend.The only good parts were the many examples of different types of dreams, and how to interpret based on your own symbols without asking anyone else.The dream book I do recommend is Exploring the World of Lucid Dreaming by Stephen LaBerge & Howard Rheingold.But hey, if this is the path for you then follow it."
1,Purchased collar from manufacturer since Amazon was out of stock. I am VERY disappointed and would never put this thing on my cat. Very restricting collar with uncomfortable neck. Looks better in picture than the real deal....Debbie
1,"I picked this up at the library this afternoon solely because of Stephen King's high praise, and now I'm wondering if I should bother with the other two books I also checked out at his recommendation. The book is well and often wittily written (NOT well-constructed, mind you), and I afford it two stars for that, but that's the only good thing I can say about it. The protagonist is so poorly fleshed-out that I never even bothered to form a picture of him in my head (and certainly don't care what he may be up to in her next novel), and the remaining characters are either equally boring or so over-the-top as to be unbelievable. The most annoying, unsatisfying, unforgivable thing however is the author's lazy use of the deux ex machina to ""tie up"" one of the story lines. This felt like three short stories - only one of them at all compelling - forced together to make up a ""novel."" Really, really disappointing."
1,Beautiful book with lots of great pictures of old recipes. I didn't find one recipe that I would make that I don't already. It is an older book and there are plenty of more up to date books that reflect the newer trends in food.
1,"Is it just me, or is this the exact same book as Emotional Intelligence?I thought Emotional Intelligence was a good book, but it seemed like in this book Goleman just replaced the word ""Emotional"" with ""Social"" and sold us a new book.If you have already read Emotional Intelligence, save your money on this book. If not, an interesting read."
1,For a silicone spatula it is not heat-resistant. The first time I used it the edges cracked. Plus it is not flexible so you can only use it at certain angles. Waste of money...I sold it in my garage sale!I recommend Le Creuset instead.
2,"When i ordered this book I didn't know much about it but it was sooooooo great. I loe Mr. Zahns writing and this is an incredible book. He seems to just bring you into the story. And the way he tells about Luke's part of the story makes you wake up and go-okay now I see it! I defianlty recommend this book to anyone who likes Star Wars, MR Zahn, or Sciece fiction books."
2,This is a very good product. Was easy to install and has been easy to operate. The quality of the picture is excellent.
2,"So far, so good! Lightweight and seems to get good reception. Good walking companion! Would recommend."
1,"bought these last year. when they came, i discovered that at least one in each box had no liquid in the bubble mast. very disappointing!"
2,"My 3-year-old son is fully engrossed with both Toy Story movies right now, so I thought it was a wonderful coincidence when we accidentally found this ""Nighttime Rescue"" Buzz at our local Target. (Woody and Wheezie the Penguin were there to boot.)Although our son loves Buzz and appears ready to form some sort of crime-fighting team with him, this particular model is sometimes frustrating for little ones to handle. The toy is top heavy and usually falls over when you try to stand him up, and unlike the movie Buzz we all know and love, this one doesn't have wings. (Oddly enough, I'm more disturbed by this than my son.)Minor quibbles aside, the toy is pretty sturdy and has a wide range of motions that are perfect for a wee one who wants Buzz to reach for the sky and just about anything else. ""Nighttime"" Buzz also has a laser cannon on his right arm that makes an assortment of fun-sounding explosions. Definitely worth the price."
2,"This most recent compilation is one of the finest compilation of groups and songs that I have heard in quite some years. The remaining members of The Doors haven't lost a step, as each track is filled with the same energy that doors fans remember from a long time ago. This unique arrangement of talent, from Train to Aerosmith to Creed to Days of the New, all paid their respects to one of the finest bands ever assembled....I'd reccomend this album to any true fan of rock and roll."
2,"If you like a game that requires thought and imagination, you need to try the Planescape campaign. The world is an interesting blend of steampunk & magic. The handbook covers all you need more, but I still wish it could be longer despite being complete in and of itself. It's just so fun to leaf through and drool over the amazing cool work. I'm not really into most gaming because of the emphasis on combat a lot of games have, but this particular setting allows for a wide variety of roleplaying. Just be sure to find a GM with a good imagination!"
2,"Tom is an excellent writer and has a great sense of humor. I enjoyed this book and it helped me realize I to can be successful in network marketing. It taught me not to take myself too seriously,stay focused and always have a sense of humor."
2,"I had to read this book in 11th grade english class. I had never read anything on the Arthurian legend before, and this book turned on an interest I never knew was there. White is an incredibly gifted writer that makes this ancient story come to life. It's good for children and adults alike!"
2,"Lovely coming of age story of a young boy who is struggling to understand himself in relation to the world and the people around him. Love the narrative voice and the simple language which is perfectly suited to the character. Delightful and easy to read, finished in 2 days."
1,"Although this is a great product, my biggest turn off was that certain low frequency weren't passing through the unit. So when I was playing a song the bass line would sound weird. I downgraded back to the BX-10 and love it."
1,It seems amazon wants to clear out some inventory before adding the new one.THIS IS NOT THE IPOD THAT WAS RELEASED A FEW DAYS AGO(this may seem obvious...but I know of a few people that have been burned already)
2,"I don't know if the author of this book was using a different type of perl or what, but I have had to troubleshoot a lot of his code. I have read only three chapters so far, and I've had to get people to help me figure out what was wrong with the code the author has written on three different code examples. I do think this is a good book, though. From one point of view, this is a great learning process. You get to know the code pretty dang well when you have to study it sometimes as long as an hour before you figure out what was wrong with it."
2,"As a movie goer and watcher, Jet Li is one of the greatest martial artists alive... This movie was a great flick, because of the drama, romance, and sad realization of what was happening. The fight scenes were amazing and well thought up making it even more intense... With a good actress like Christy Cheung in there what could be better? Surely a mix of both talents will result in a good flick..."
1,"The quaility of the game was a lot less than I expected. That's the trouble with buying online as opposed to buying in a store. If I had seen how cheap it was made in a store , I wouldn't have bought it."
1,"I've had this toaster for a few months now. My main complaint is with the browning control. It is a dial with settings 1-6. Set to anything over 2 results in burned toast,bagel,waffle etc. There are also no detents on the control so it is easy to inadvertantly move the dial resulting in smoking ashes and not toast. This is a toaster that can't reliably produce toast."
2,"Though this album was slightly not as better than ""Regulate... G-Funk Era"" but it comes close. Using the same rotation of guest appearences on the last album and more guests like Jayo Felony and Ron Isley makes this album great. Check for tracks like ""Reality"", ""Annie Mae"", ""We Brings Heat"" and my favorite ""Relax Ya Mind"". Indeed, Warren G is the King of G-Funk."
2,"Those who enjoy TSO music will appreciate giving or receiving this boxed set at a great low combined price for all 3 CDs + DVD. While the DVD is not a concert tour video, it does introduce their earlier rock opera songs in an imaginative format. The concerts are much better quality, however, even if only viewed in person and not yet out on DVDs. I sent a few of these boxed sets out this year to those who were ""just acquainted"" with TSO's body of work, and the feedback is very generous. TSO's musical genre is much needed after hearing all the usually holiday music selections offered on radio and TV this past year. It's quality music that will endure for many years to come and is enjoyed by cross-generational afficianados of their new twist on the telling of an old story at Christmas. Definitely a ""must have"" item for the holiday season gifting."
1,"This product sucks. On my Windows XP machine I can only run this program with my firewall disabled, no other programs running, and the CD in the drive. And no wonder: I bought it from Amazon in 7/06 and it hasn't been updated since 2002. It's ancient & antiquated.Aside from the technical problems, it's just a shoddy game. The visuals are blurry, if the ""referee"" disallows a play where you've formed more than one word, it doesn't tell you which word is not allowed, it's slow, it's ""hint"" facility is ridiculous, and it uses multiple screens to accomplish simple set up tasks.Whoever owns the ""Scrabble"" name should be ashamed to have it on this game. It's particularly sad because a few years ago there was at least one excellent crossword game (Crosswise) that the company that owns Scrabble (Hasbro at the time, I think) ran out of business by threatening to sue them. Too bad they didn't buy out Crosswise and use it as the basis for electronic Scrabble.What a waste!"
1,I was soooooo disappointed with this purchase!! This thing LEAKED no matter what! I ended up throwing it in the trash at a work meeting because it wasn't even worth carrying back home. Garbage!
1,"I was hoping to find 200 top-rated recipes from allrecipes.com. The site itself does not sort recipes by rating, so you must scroll until you find ""IT""--a recipe like Baked Pork Chops which received a 5-star rating from 1488 cooks! Now, that inspires confidence!This book will not provide you with tempting photos and 5-star recipes rated by thousands of cooks. Instead, unfortunately, these recipes' ratings are all over the place. For example, several were rated by only 7 cooks----7 cooks who only gave them four stars. And, oh, yea, the only photo is on the cover."
2,Excellent scanner; resets all OBDII codes with explanation of codes; excellent product and a fantastic price. Highly recommended.
2,This lock solved all my problems. I had people who would take the pin out of the gate arm and come onto my property. Now there is no way to pull the locking pin out. This is a must purchase for anyone who is considering a security gate.
1,"how to ruin good storytelling 101: muck up what is nuanced in characters; add distracting cgi; refuse to fix the larger technical and editorial problems in the classic series. Finally, ignore your fan-base while trying to sell them the exact opposite of what they want."
2,"I bought several of the cables, one of them didn't quite fit properly but the rest were fine. Great bargain, even with shipping costs."
1,"I really wanted to like this CD, I really did. There's just one problem, it isn't that good. Now I know all about it I read all about how they used vintage insturments and recording equipment to get that special sound. It's just that the special sound doesn't work. It sounds to much like they are playing in some dump of a bar filled with smoke and drunks, and the songs don't work for me. They lost the edge they had on the previous two albums. What happened"
1,"Unfortunately, Bostonian too has cut back on quality. The previous pair I had owned kept me happy for several years and a couple soles. They were good Italian leather and held up very well to wear. This most recent pair are, of course, Chinese leather and they are of a noticeably lower quality for the same money. If you're willing to pay their price I recommend paying the extra $30.00 for Johnson and Murphy or $15.00 for the Florshiem."
2,"Let me start by saying that I have been a Harry Connick, Jr. fan ever since ""When Harry Met Sally"" and I absolutely loved ""She"" and ""Star Turtle"". They were very funky and fun, and I got to see both tours. Amazing shows, both of them. He always has the best musicians playing with him and keeps out of the spotlight long enough to let them shine! What a guy.""Come by Me"" is definitely not like his funky albums. It's a complete return to his big band sound, which I also loved. And this one is wonderful to listen to. He sounds terrific, and once again has surrounded himself with some very talented people. I must say, however, that I'm sorry to see the Funky Harry take a backseat...I loved that sound!"
2,"Ms. Edwards has strong heroines, usually with a martial bent and a sad love affair in the past. Always a touch of magic to the tales as well. All the books I know about are listed on amazon. Big disappointment that the The Bastard Princess series wasn't finished."
1,Hey this game would be ok if the matches could last more than 5 seconds!!! But the graphics are the best I have ever seen in any fighting or sports game ever!! I suggest renting this one first!
2,"This single is a must have! NO SURPRISES from the bands third album O.K.COMPUTER is a mellow sweet diddy that is one of the best songs from O.K.COMPUTER. PALO ALTO has a rough sound that traces back towards music from PABLO HONEY. Not one of there best songs but worth having. HOW I MADE MY MILLIONS is by far one of the best radiohead songs ever. A quiet piano enhanced tune that is sung beautifully by tom york. Though the lyrics are hard to understand, Its sad heart breaking tone is a must have. Any Radiohead fan shouldn't be without it."
1,"If you do not want to hear the ending STOP reading now. I love movies that have happy endings. If you also love happy endings, season 3 IS NOT for you. This movie has one death that is hard to take, and if Anna and Bates happiness is suppose to compensate for that death, all I can say is the writers are not reading their customers (viewers) correctly. As for this seasons ending, this better be one of those cliff hangers where he is JUST seriously injured and lives after all. I will not be pre-ordering season 4, thats for sure."
1,"UNFORTUNATELY, I'M UNABLE TO RATE THIS ITEM BECAUSE I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THIS ITEM YET.R/ALVIN BLUE JR"
1,"This book provided some of the most misleading, slanted view of nutrition I have read in a while. As the author demonized grains in general I found myself so very frustrated. As a Dietitian I am quite aware of the benefits of a whole grain based diet. I am quite aware that one of Americas downfalls is an overconsumption of refined grain products, but equally so, one of Americas number one problems is its underconsumption of whole grains. This book is a set up for environmental and long term health disaster. This book seems to promote the overconsumption of protein which can destroy a persons health almsot as fast as it destroys resources. In addition, treating the general public as Diabetics is a sure way to set up for failure."
1,"I lost my mother at the age of 16 on 12/24/98. This book was recommended to me by a lady saying it would help me, it didn't. In fact, it made me scared to have kids from the accounts of other womens' horror stories of trying to raise thier childeren after they had lost thier mother. Hope Edelman had lost her mother to cancer, as did seem a lot of the other women. She didnt touch down on other diseases besides cancer and also sucide. My mother died of a form of heart disease. It was mentioned only a couple of times. It was hard to read knowing that is Edelman's opion, Motherless Daughters will never heal. That they carry pain with them for the rest of thier lives. As true as it may be, it has severly put a negative outlook on my oun mouring. And for the record, childern can mourn just as long if not more than adults. And it hurts just as much. No matter how old you are........."
2,"It took the record company more than 25 years to realize the well known fact to every Roxy Musics fan: You can't mix things of the band from the early 70s with titles from the 80s and Ferry solos. The music is different, the listeners are different. ""Early years"" includes titles from the 3 albums (Roxy Music, For your pleasure and Stranded) plus the 2 singles (Virginia and Pyjama). The collection is good and reflects well the brilliant music of the band in the years 1972-74. If you want to taste something else - try this. Virginia Plain sounds as green and fresh as it was almost 30 years ago."
1,"I think most of the reviewers here have missed the point by complaining about the multitude of errors in this book! The idea, of course, is to force the reader to work out the contradictions, inconsistencies and outright incorrectness of the questions and answers and thereby encourage a true understanding of the subject. What a great book this really is, it obviously aims to train the reader to deal with the gluttony of misinformation that exits in the ""real world"". Of course, some readers may want the easy way out and not want to find the secret errors that proliferate throughout this book, but instead want a reference book that will simply, yet comprehensively, explain computer networking fundamentals. For these people, this is NOT the book to buy."
2,"It is hard to read this book in more than two or three days... and you know what that means (as other reviewers have warned): neglect of sleep, work, home family, etc. It is a very compelling story excellently written that grabbed me emotionally in an unexpectedly intense way. The book really isn't about chess, so don't worry if you aren't all that interested in chess. Chess is just part of the setting. Likewise, if you are familiar with Walla Walla,Whitman College, or Topanga Canyon you'll enjoy the settings, but they're just the backdrop. The book really is about the intense desperation that young love can bring. It's also a terrific tale that will keep you turning the pages into the night. When you're done, the feelings that this book elicited in you will remain for a long long time. This is one you should not miss reading, and sharing."
2,"THIS CASE OFFERS GOOD SCRATCH PROTECTION; IT COMPLETELY COVERS THE MP3 PLAYER EXCEPT FOR THE CONTROLS. IT DID NOT HOWEVER HAVE A LARGE ENOUGH AREA AT THE BOTTOM FOR THE USB CABLE TO PLUG IN CORRECTLY. THE HOLE NEEDED TO BE SLIGHTLY LARGER. OTHERWISE, I LIKE IT."
2,"Great little blues/rock album. Came outta nowhere and enjoyed ZERO publicity. Relegated to cut-out/throw away bin status...what a shame. This kid was an Ausie who really had IT. I understand he was extremely ill and not sure what ever became of him after this record. If you like Jonny Lange,Kenny Wayne Sheppard and the sort,you will certainly appreciate this record. Hes not exactly the shredder that those guys are but take it for what it is...this kid was like TWELVE years old when it came out. He was surrounded by a very solid group of players and the production value is excellent as well. The kid does a couple of tasty covers and the rest are well written by HIM. This is a great one to have! Throw it on and impress people with this hidden gem. Its a shame nothing more was heard from him."
2,Get the full blown version of this DVD. The video is incredible and the Dolby Digital Soundtrack is unbelievable! This is a must have DVD for 5.1 digital systems. I just wish I had seen it at the local IMAX theatre.
2,Yes these dishes are tiny and at $24.00 too expensive. But for the sale price I think they are worth it. They are adorable and the perfect size for dipping sauces and pinch bowls.And I expected them to be tiny since the description says that they are the perfect size for a mis en bouche.
2,"I absolutely love this cookbook. Every single recipe I have tried is delicious, and like the title indicates,full of flavour. The chapters are organized by flavour, so that you can easily accommidate whatever youcrave. The recipes are quite diverse, so that you won't get bored. The photographs are beautiful and a good visual aide. You can plan a dinner party from this cookbook - appetizers, main course, sides, and dessert."
1,"Well, I guess since Air have evolved their sound, creating spectacular new and original albums, Zero 7 have fallen behind and don't know what to copy next. The Simple Things album was a complete Air rip-off wannabe album, and now Zero 7 are having trouble finding what to copy. Hey Zero 7- How about coming up with your own material!"
1,"This book was taken from a public library and resold on Amazon. It still has the card slot glued in the back, the library labeling and a clear plastic cover that the library put on it to protect it! NOT COOL!"
2,"This album to phat the album has good beats because swizz beatz did most of the songs, and the lox can rap, and so can jadakiss solo if u don't like ruff ryders then don't buy this"
1,"It is a questionable practice for a producer to make all his protagonists completely unsympathetic. Characters ranged from driven by lust and gluttony to selfishly using others to gain quick wealth (greed and vanity). Even though the plot allows the possibility of a character arc and redemption, the main protagonist barely takes advantage of it. I initially preferred to give this zero stars, but on further consideration I think one star is justified: this movie proves to me that Sacha Baron Cohen cannot act, so I saved myself from seeing Borat. On the other hand, I give this three stars for Boring and five stars for Stupid, giving it an overall rating of four stars on my BS scale."
1,"Careful you don't expect the audio editions of this book to be identical to the hardback version. True, the FIVE stories included are present unabridged... but the remaining NINE stories in the hardcover edition do not appear at all in the audio versions, CD or cassette...Thanks."
1,"We have four cats and none of them would touch these treats. I was really hoping they would like them because I like that they are supposed to have a calming effect. Whenever we go out of town it is very stressful on our cats so it would have been nice if these treats would work - I have no idea if they do work, however, since the cats wouldn't eat them. I am a professional pet sitter so I brought the treats to a few of my clients' homes and none of their cats would touch them either."
1,"Because I have previous DVD's created by this yoga instructor, this DVD is useless!!! Waste of my money. All it is is recycled clips from other DVD's. Why this is not stated on the preview through Amazon is a mystery to me. I guess its all about $$$$ and they got mine!!"
1,"I was looking for a book that would help me upgrade our home security system. This looked like the one. NOT!To say it was superficial would be to give it too much credit. The section on installation was 3 pages long. It's chock full of fluff, nothing is covered in enough depth to be of any use.I was hoping to find out how the pros pulled wires into walls -- what tools they used, what tricks they used, etc. NOT!I was looking for a book that would discuss the features available in various systems and which ones were useful. NOT!Save your money. I sent my book back, but I still had to pay the shipping both ways.I was so disappointed!"
2,"As a child, one often thinks ""this kind of stuff doesn't happen in other people's families!"" Mary Karr has written a wonderful memoir that lets you know it certainly does ! It has a certain power that makes the reader know life is really not ""The Brady Bunch"" for a whole lot of us. It's written with humor, emotion, and raw honesty about how getting through a tumultuous childhood and rising above it is truly a blessing. Through all the madness and turmoil, this is a family who loves each other in spite of it all. Very enjoyable !!"
2,"If you grew up in the computer generation this book will bring joy to your heart. Techno-nostalgia litters every page of this quality paperback. Glossy screenshots and pictures of game packaging act as a magnet, pulling the memories of games gone by from the deepest parts of the reader's brain. This book brings back memories of Donkey Kong!, Lode Runner, M.U.L.E., Rocket Ranger, Space Quest, and many of the great dynasties of the game world. Wilson and DeMaria have pulled together a virtual encyclopedia of special memories. The only way that this gaming tome could have been improved would have been to provide the games with it. Even without the games, readers will exult in this quality portrayal of their hobby and those who helped propel it forward into the 21st century. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
2,"This is a high quality plug for a generator. I had an industrial electrician install this he couldn't believe this was bought as a consumer item, not through a commercial supplier."
2,"My forerunner 205 works great for walking, running, driving, even on a plane!I used it on a cross country plane trip, and then loaded the the trip online to see maps of where I'd been, and what I'd seen. During the trip I could see our elevation, heading and speed.The device works as advertized, and it's very customizable."
2,"I ordered this cd after I went to the Casting Crowns Christmas Concert in November, and Natalie Grant was a special guest. I ordered it with hopes of it arriving quickly to enjoy during the holiday season. It arrived within 2 days of my ordering and is a fantastic cd - it focuses your attention on Jesus's birth and also has some oldie-but-goodies!"
2,"I am a 38 yr old male who has never been truly dedicated to the gym. I started working out regularly, they started taking No Shotgun and T-bomb II. Since I started both at the same time, I cannot guarantee, if it's one or both combined, but WOW!!!, I get great pumps, work out much longer and harder, typically close to two hours daily, 5 days a week. Would recommend this to the older crowd, younger guys shouldn't mess w/ their testosterone levels, stick w/ the shotgun and protien, ect.."
1,"This is not an interesting movie at all. I don't like for the fact that, with the subject matter and it being released shortly after ""The Haunted Mansion"" and some evil holiday film from Disney's adult divisions, this ended up being considered ""a Disney movie!""Well, at least the outtakes were hilarious! And on scene 9, you can make out the old scary 1975-1991 Universal TV logo theme. But still, for the other reasons above, I didn't like it!Moral of story: watch the ""Mighty Ducks"" trilogy instead!"
2,"With the exception of a few abrupt segues, I enjoyed this book immensely. The female characters are rich and diverse. The story line has just enough mystery and magic to hook the reader, yet remain believable. I liked the way Hoffman wove the historical events of a small town and its treatment of a woman with the current happenings to her descendents. This is a morality story, it's a love story, it's a story of mother-daughter relationships, it's a story of the rites of passage from adolescence to adulthood, it's a story of small town politics and fear, and finally it's a story about the loneliness and courage it takes to be different and trust in your probable future."
2,The essence of this album is unbelieveable! KaZual's vocals are sweet harmony and the beats just make you wanna get up and dance. I Love It and I bought It! You should try it too.
2,"It's got angst, powerful meaning, intelligent drama, rhythm, EVERYTHING!!! - and yet it's also very singable. This wonderful CD is entrancing...it has had me mesmerized since it came out in 1991!"
2,"In this case, ""good"" is emerald green, the color of ""will"" vs. ""bad"" yellow, the color of ""fear"". The intergalactic peacekeepers were the green good guys. But the good guys were getting bumped off by the fear energy, which continued to gain strength as it sucked the life-force energy out of every green man it came into contact with. As one of the head good guys is dying on earth, after his space ship crashes, he sets his emerald ring to seek out and find someone to take his place. The ring finds an earthling.It's a cute, fun movie. If you watch the end credits, you get the impression there is a route for a Green Lantern #2."
1,"The one I have now is a replacement from Amazon and I'm just guessing how efficient it is; but, I can't get it to work a 2nd time...at all."
2,"You'd Think That It's Just Another Breakout Clone, Right?Well, Thats Not Exactly True.It's Break 'Em All. There'sA Mode Where You Battle Bosses.Graphics - 8.0Sound - 7.0Gameplay - 9.5All in All - 9.0"
2,"A friend recommended this album to me a few months ago and I am so glad I bought it! Hayley Westenra is a name I'm sure we are all going to be hearing a lot more of soon - she has a gift that we are lucky to share, I can't wait to see her tour."
2,Joe Satriani comes through once again. My husband and I never get tired of listening to his music
2,"Joe and Merle were friends for years, often appearing on Town Hall Party in Compton Califonia. Joe was one of the fastest guitar pickers in the world, while Merle played his famous Travis Still finger picking. This is a must for anyone interested in guitar legends."
2,"This is the best book I have read all year. I did not want this story to end. If you only read one book this year, this should be it!"
1,"It started out good but after a few chapters, I lost interest.The outline was sound. However, it tended to be too drawn out to hold my attention.It could have used a few more realistic examples/scenarios in how to handle those types of situations that Dr. Laura is advising the reader to avoid.I would have also enjoyed a little more humor as parenting, requires it."
2,"I ordered this as a wedding gift for an out-of-town relative. When I received it, I added the bride and groom's initials at the top, and the wedding date at the bottom before I sent it on the couple. The bride was over the moon with the gift, and said she was thrilled when she and her husband opened it! It was a great quality candle, and I wouldn't hesitate to order it again if the need arises!!"
1,Awful for bike riding. Air flow blows this vest up and around your neck. I wish I had paid more for a zipper vest.
1,"After so much success with PERFECT STORM, Junger rapidly released another book.But, to my surprise, it was not made of original material1 IT's just a compilation of old magazine articles from old times!!Come on, Junger, you can do better than that to cash some more money!This intention behind this book is so commercial, that they even used terribly small letter type in the mass market papaerback edition, to reduce the number of pages and, consenquently, the cost, while selling the book all the same by thu usual US$ 7.99! Shame on you, Mr. Junger!"
1,"Like most of ALW's so called ""music"", this Requiem is complete musical pap. I am completely bewildered by the popularity of this hack. He hasn't written anything decent since his score to ""The Odessa File"", a surprisingly promising effort, but following his ""career"" has been a downhill ride ever since. I'll never forget the time I first played through much of his Phantom of the Opera. I started laughing so hysterically at its crappiness and total lack of inspiration, I rolled off the bench to the floor to the amusement of several singers. The new Phantom score by Claude Michel Schonberg is no masterpiece, but it's loads better then Webber's feeble attempt. I rank this Requiem as the worst ever attempted. If I was the composer, I'd be ashamed to put my name to it. I would have done with it what Sibelius supposedly did to his eighth symphony...toss it in a roaring fire, page by page"
1,"I wish that I had more carefully considered all these other opinions that suggest this book is not that good...because now I agree. On my best day I am barely an intermediate web designer and this book had not ONE secret to offer me. The Studio Secrets book it is for beginners only - the HTML is the same as any other beginner book, and the scripting samples you can pull off of virtually any web page."
1,"You would think that Hanes, the underware experts, would be able to design a compfortable pare of boxer shorts but you would be wrong! I hink Hanes was trying to get fancy and designed the back of these shorts with an insert so there are two seams running on the back side instead of one seam down the middle. Consequently the underware is uncomfortable to move or sit in because you are always rubbing on the seams and it bunches up in the back. DO NOT BUY."
1,"I am generally a fan of Nee's writings, but this one left me quite cold. His claim is that God does not act unless a person prays. I do not agree that this is the nature of God. I think God can and does act independent of man, but responds to man's prayers too. I think He likes us to pray so that when it does happen, we know it was Him who did it and that we thank Him, but I cannot agree that God needs man to pray else His hands are tied."
1,"The first Schwinn Fitness 212 that was sent never arrived because it was damaged in transit. The second one arrived but does not work. After calling technical assistance and being instructed to re-examine the contacts (which I did), it still does not work. This is absolutely useless. They will have to do something."
1,"I can't help but agree with the other reviewers that say that this CD is nothing more than a crass commercial ploy by Buffett to get his hands on some of that Country Music scene money and is, in a word, crap. I also admit that Liz O'Connor and Bill Jabanoski's CDs are much better than anything Jimmy has done in years and years. However, they are both much younger performers with fresh ideas and Jimmy was even better then them when he was their age. It's just another case of the changing of the guard. Yes Jimmy, it is time to stop making a fool out of yourself and head out to pasture, but thanks for all the great music and memories."
1,"Apparently I live too far out in the country to be able to use the Kindle. I had to drive 13 miles from my home to even get a weak signal. I bought the product so that I could buy books from home, at my leisure, but if I have to get in the car and drive over 13 miles just to download a book, it really isn't worth it. I returned it 2 days after I got it. I was very disappointed because I am an avid reader and thought this product would be perfect for me."
2,"Since I received the CD of Alexander Feht's ""Demon"" from Amazon.com, I listen to it several times per day. IMHO, Feht's revival of the Russian art song genre melds his own innovative creative work will those resembling Rachmaninov. The lyrics of some songs are Pushkin's poetry, and if I were Pushkin, I'd encourage Feht to set my poetry to music. Feht innovatively chose the Russian singers to sing the songs on this CD. They're great, and they weren't chosen for him. I suggest that Feht write the music for an opera based on Dostoyevsky's ""Crime and Punishment."" Carl Zimmerman, Teaneck, NJ, USA"
1,"If you really want some good pop/punk I would recommend the following: Fall Out Boy, Bayside, Matchbook Romance, Hey Mercedes, and/or Sugarcult... Save your money and listen to Top 40 radio if you want to hear GC..."
1,"this movie is so horrible to watch; its a torture. At first you are like ok this movie is just starting it will get better. Ok they cannot stay in this scene any longer. Like the other revier said, ""I do not know if I should keep watching it to see if it becomes better."" Trust me it did not get better. Its so boring and so lame. The ending is the worst part. It ends where it begins with another family. Typical ending."
1,"Received this coffee maker as a gift in Dec '08. Carafe does not keep coffee hot for any length of time. Can feel warm spots on thermal carafe indicating poor qc on insulation. Manfacturer admits faulty product and will send a new carafe, but I have to pay the $10.00 shipping fee. I objected to the $10.00 but this ""customer unfriendly"" company ignored my objection.I will NEVER purchase ANYTHING from this company because they failed to fully backed their product. I recommend buying American or from any another company that believes in customer service!"
1,You will get good sound from these headphones. But the the wires (from both sides) will break from just normal daily use after about 8 months. Now I am stuck with unrepairable junk. I guess $25 gets you 10 months of headphone use nowadays. Would steer clear of these from now on.
2,"I'm not emo. I listen to a lot of bands in the grey area that borders on emo (Elliot Smith, Death Cab for Cutie)but i'm not running out to buy Chirs Cararabbas back catolouge any time soon.That said, I love this album. I love the way it makes me feel. It's really warm and inviting and calms me down like no other album. The lyrics are undeniably emo and I don't mind. When they do get under your skin a little bit its easy to just tune them out and listen to the hooks and interplaying guitar lines. Speaking of the hooks, theyre all amazing and unlike anything else called emo. Usailly when i think of emo its either distorted chord shredding or remidial accoustic guitar. Thank god for this, the one peice of listenable emo I know of. Actually I like bright eyes too but thats a different story."
1,"The original ""Pumpkinhead"" was a brilliant movie. This sequel is an insult to the original. The backwoods setting is moved to what looks like the suburbs and the kids all know where the withc lives!! Even in the original Ed Harley had to get help finding her. The plot is juvenile and the effects are nowhere near as creepy as the original. Don't even bother with this one, just watch the original again."
1,"The cd has a great collection of music an elder gent friend loves , but it arrived cracked and I had to take a chance and give it to him anyway, as there was not time to exchange before the holidays. Thankfully it works fine and we replaced the clear plastic case, but that is not a good way to do business."
2,"This film is not just a typical children's cartoon, or even the usual Winnie the Pooh story. After years of fearing the dreaded Heffalumps who live on the other side of the fence in the Hundred Acre Wood, Roo finally encounters one in the form of Lumpy, an adorable young Heffalump. While the two become friends, they both discover that each of them has been fed a lifetime of prejudice about the other, and lived in fear of the unknown.The film gives a great lesson about the dangers of prejudice, and the innocence of children to break through the irrational fears of adults. (Or, in this case, Pooh and the rest of his friends). This is one film marketed for children that parents will not mind watching over and over with their children. It is very well made, has a great story and wonderful original music by Carly Simon. It is rare these days to see a full-length cartoon with a lesson, and not just slapstick."
1,"This is just awful; at times the singer wasn't even in tune. I don't know how this CD managed to be distributable because frankly, it's a joke. Or at least, I hope it is..."
2,"If you play xbox or want to use it as a media center, this is a must. But never, ever pay full price and don't subscribe. You can always find a deal on these, and take advantage of it when you do."
1,"Ok, I love metallica all their past stuff is awsome, i went out and bought this cd the day it came out and..it sucks! it sounds like Korn, the mixing is horrible, and unlike what everyone was saying, it does NOT go back to thier roots.I was very dissapointed with this album, if you're a metallica fan don't waste your time, or money buying this album"
2,I really enjoyed reading this little book. I found it so cute and like the humorous nuggets of information. Sissy LeBlanc is a true Southern Belle.
2,"Out of the many step tapes that I have done this one really works you hard. It is well-organized, easy to follow and uses weights while stepping to get the fastest, most complete workout."
2,"A movie about tradition, dignity, and beauty. Sometimes we need to be reminded of what is truly important in the world; this movie does just that! Just watch it!!!"
1,"I gave up after the first chapter. There is no meaningful recap as to what has happened to the hero so far. It reminded me of those dreary pseudo-English epics Hollywood churned out in the 1930s, with caricatures of English officers. Despite my interest in the history of the British in India, especially the Mutiny era, I felt I would have no interest in what happened to the hero's horse, let alone the hero and his poorly-drawn lady love. Even the Duke of Wellington is a cardboard cutout. The dialogue is dreadful. This author seems to be some formulaic imitator of some contemporary English naval-ficton author, and I don't mean Hornblower's creator. This may motivate me to write my own stories.Give me George MacDonald Fraser any day, with loads of research and lots of real dialogue.Why did I waste the money buying this in hardback?"

1,"Unfortunately it lacks authority. There are no citations and all we get are phrases such as ""scientists are becoming concerned"", people believe"" and so on. What people think or believe is not important, what matters is empirical research and this author refers to none. It consists entirely of largely unattributed opinion. Every word of it may be true, but it could equally be a collection of imaginative musings. This book was given to me as essential information, but my scientific opinion is that it is superficially interesting but of little use."
2,I find the Video IPOD to be an elegant and effective tool for every purpose I have for such a machine.
1,"I'm not rating the furniture or Simplicity, I'm rating Baby Universe for shipping the wrong furniture. I didn't notice that they sent a combo of the Walnut and Cherry changing tables from the Ellis line. So, when my friends and I attempted to put it together, the screw holes on the cabinet pieces didn't line up. I thought that maybe it was me, so I called my cousin, the handy-man, to see if he could fix it. As we looked closer, we noticed that some pieces were lighter than others. Simplicity instructs you to call them if something's wrong and I did. They're sending an entirely new unit to me and will pay for shipping to return the faulty/unmatched unit. I'm due in 2 weeks so I'm purchasing a playpen/changing table/bassinet in case I deliver before Simplicity does."
1,"A good cast starring Milla Jovovich and the venerable Will Patton.Half way through you're OK. But then it gets weaker and weaker until you find no end to ""The End"". At least not in the traditional Horror, Sci-fi genre. It's as if the director ran out of money and used a lenghty on-screen script to finalize his endeavor. The audience is left hanging with quite a bit of unresolved situations previously introduced. No resolve!The cinematography is awfully pale considering the location.The sets are droll.If you're going to do a ""true story"" piece you had better be right on or at least introduce a bit more melodrama to even the score."
1,Simply put - I purchased this Astronomy book through Amazon because the price was the same as elsewhere but I would save on shipping. I expected a NEW book but received a Used Book in good condition.The Book itself so far seems well laid out and interesting but the course I am taking has just reached the 1/3 mark toward completion.
2,"well....i love this cd..but the only thing i was gonna mention is that the new girl known as ""fergie"" (stacie ferguson sp?) yeah. well she was in wild orchid!! strange egh? yeeah...hmm.. image changed ... alot ... for someone born in 1975. i mean, yeah nice voice & all...but i would of thought black eyed peas would of added a more hip hop/r&b/rap groupie. yea no?! someone thats been in the underground rap scene for long while. yet they got stacie from wild orchid...okay...jes thought yal should know that..but dont get me wrong..im not sayin its a bad thing.."
2,This is my favorite book in the universe... we bought copies for all our grandchildren!
2,"John Grisham, while one of my favorite writers, writes a book that starts out very well, has a good structure and storyline, but sometimes moves slowly. You'll notice I gave it Four Stars. My correct rating would be ***, just for the record, good, but not Grisham's best (that's gotta be THE CLIENT or THE RAINMAKER)."
2,very happy with purchase will be buying more dvd's in the near future and look forward to shopping for more selections
2,"I dont know everyone's experience, but they only way this could go wrong is if the wires inside the HDMI connection broke...I think that would be hard to do. I think these cables are great. They are cheap and function as they should. I bought a bunch and i am happy about that."
1,"I agree with Frey that his memory is subjective and that certain dates, times, names are altered, whatever. But to lie and say that you spent three months in jail after getting out and driving straight to your girlfriend's house to find she'd committed suicide is a complete joke. Can we believe any of this book, seriously? Yes, he was in rehab. No doubt. But I'm even questioning the dental work he got at this point. And it's despicable to insert himself into a starring role in the train wreck tragedy of those girls. One caveat: He's a great writer with a GREAT imagination. I feel conned by this book"
1,"I bought 2 of these from Northern Tool. I wanted to move a 4 wheel trailer and some equipment around the shop yard. The rims are aluminum and break at the hubs.Trying to make turns, the axles and tires just gave out. Maybe for an small, lightweight 2 wheel trailer they'll work ok. But heavy duty? Not even close."
1,"The purchase was a disappointment. At the time of order, your page did not indicate that the book has two volumes. Had it indicated in some way, I would have ordered for Volume II because the information I seek is in the later part of the title. You should have included Volume Number in your website.Oo"
1,"I was very disappointed in the packing of this item. Two of the four dishes were shattered into many pieces. There seemed to be no cushioning in the box; it was just a box of dishes inside a cardboard shipping container. Amazon has done well for me before, but I will not order anything this fragile from them again."
1,This was a disappointment. They should say in the product information that it is only good for TVs made after 1997. The set I have is older and I was hopeful this product would solve my problem.
1,I tried reading this book but could not find anything entertaining about it. It's horrible. Do not purchase!!
1,"As long as you don't mind spending [price] to replace the unit every 6 months or so, the Littermaid self-cleaning litter box is wonderful. I have 5 indoor cats. For about 6 months the product is a God-send. Especially if you use the premium scoopable litter. Nice smell and clumps in a way that the box ""likes"". The obvious down-side is that LitterMaid hasn't quite figured out how to create a product that works well for any length of time. Some day, somebody will invent a similar product that really works. Don't ever try to deal with LitterMaid's customer service."
2,"It was so easy to ""dial"" these up on Amazon. Several seconds later we were watching these classic Simpson's Halloween episodes. We had been telling our daughters about them. Like Amazon (we have Prime), they always deliver. Our daughters enjoy them, too, since they, like us, have a warped sense of humor."
2,"In a world obsessed with celebrities' every move, Billy Crystal delivers a smart, sassy satire with heart. He brings a hilarious portrayal of celebrity breakups to the screen by telling the triangle of Gwen Harrison, Eddie Thomas and Kiki Harrison.Catherine Zeta-Jones shines as Gwen, the overdemanding much- lauded starlet, and John Cusack is brilliant as Eddie Thomas, her estranged husband and former co-star. Julia Roberts taking a role somewhat in the shadows, is perfect as Gwen's sister, Kiki, whose life is devoted to satisfying every want and whim of Gwen. Having seen Julia as Anna Scott ( Notting Hill ), it was refreshing to see her tackle a different type of character, one who lives in the shadows of the famous, but shines in her own right.The film is smart and funny while delivering a sweet storyline about the choices we make over who we love, when guided by others and the DVD is enjoyable with deleted scenes. Add it to your movie collection today!"
2,The whole family really enjoyed movie. Great for a movie day. Cant wait for next movie to come out. Great!
2,"I highly recommend this book for parents who are exhausted from trying to get their kids to sleep! I have used Dr. Fleiss's method with my 5-month old son, and he goes to sleep SO much easier than my first two children ever did. The book also helped me to reverse the bad sleep habits that my 2 & 3/4 year old had gotten into. I now can put three children to bed early and enjoy a relaxing evening, knowing that they are getting the rest they need. If you're afraid of letting your child cry (as I did), please read this book. It explains exactly what the consequences of the crying-it-out method are, backing it all up with the latest scientific studies. This book is so helpful. It has changed my entire thinking about sleep, and my children's needs regarding sleep. We're all much happier and well-rested thanks to Dr. Fleiss!"
2,If you are a Secret fan be prepared not to see Esther Hicks in this version. This version takes you on a near similar journey of discovering the Law of Attraction. If you enjoyed the first movie you may find yourself a little disappointed on how they edited this version. If its your first time I feel they are even more intent in bringing the concept to a clearer understanding. This version reminds me when Lucas re-released Star Wars episode 3 with the new footage added on. It was OK but the original had more soul to it. Consequently Esther Hicks added quite a bit of her inspiring wisdom to the first version that's completely removed in the extended edition.Aside from that The Secret regardless of version still remains in my top ten collection of inspiring and thought provoking movies.
1,This album is garbage.... Just a pile of junk. Why did they put out this? It sounds like a bunch of trash. Metallica is way past its prime... and its going to be tough for them to get back in a groove.
2,"This movie actually was more scary to me than The Ring, which I didn't really find scary. One of the most frightening things was having it set in a rural atmosphere near a cornfield. I only had a slight phobia about cornfields and Field of Dreams made me feel better. Nice things are in cornfields...dead but nice baseball players. Not so with Signs! I also pet sit, mostly in the country. Between the animals that go nuts and having things run across the rooftop, this movie hightened a lot of my fears. I thought the child actors were phenomenal. What is it about those McCulkin kids? I definitely recommend this movie."
1,"ad says coded for u.s. but will not play on u.s. players, what a shame , what a waste of money !!!"
1,"Although getting a book published is an admirable feat for the average Joe, I must say that such is the only thing admirable about this author's endeavor.Without really any scientific or mathematical backing, the author talks circles around some of the most groundbreaking work in the area of physics in modern times. Rather than dispute such work with logic, however, this author uses doublespeak and ""common-sense"" analogies to dissuade the reader from believing what the greatest minds on the planet have asserted using mathematics, physics, logic, and the scientific process... to dissuade the reader, often, from believing much-proven fact.Whatever the motivation, this author's irresponsible work makes for an interesting read if one wishes to see what not to do when making an argument.If one is looking for an intelligent, persuasive, or piqueing new look at theories often taken for granted, one shuold definately look elsewhere."
1,"I'm very optimistic about an artist's work and I'm not quick to judge anybodys work as disappointing unless it's just that. Being that Mr.Ware produced and co-wrote one of the greatest albums of all time(I Want You). I was definitely eager to hear him do his own work. Although the writing is pretty good on the album, the songs just dont seem to jump out at you. There is not much to it that would makes you want to hear it again and again, and I'm a huge fan of of 70's soul. Maybe that is what Motown thought also, maybe they thought fans would rather spend their last on a sandwich. Which is maybe the reason Mr.ware didn't get the support for this album that he believed he deserved. I still honor him for his genius as a writer particularly with the work he's done with Marvin and Minnie Riperton."
1,Amazon recommended this cable for Onkyo CS-445 CD Receiver System and PSW10 Polk subwoofer....wrong cable!! needs to be a single on receiver side and a right and left input on the subwoofer side....This cable is single on both ends....
1,"I found this DVD very difficult to watch - and not because of its violent content. The manufacturers have chosen not to present it in widescreen - fair enough - but their idea of pan-and-scan seems to be to point whatever it is they point at the middle of the frame and keep it there without moving, so a lot of dialogue comes from characters who are off the edges, and it's basically a matter of luck as to whether or not important action ends up in frame."
1,"I purchased this product for my 3 yr. old grandson for his birthday because he wanted a yellow tow truck. I am sorry to say that this toy ??is way to small for a 3 yr.old as he could esily swallow it. Where this unit is not much larger than a quarter, made of PLASTIC, I feel that $15.59 plus $7.99 s/h (which is outrages charges)that a warning should be place in the advertisement that this product could be swallowed by a young child. I would send it back but not able to as once his parents showed it to him, well, you can guess the rest. Consequently, I would not reccommend this toy except to collectors. B"
1,"Quality of the peanuts are okay (on a quality rating scale of okay, good and fine) but the size of the peanuts are the smallest I have found in my local grocery chains. I only buy this brand when I am desperate...so if you are desperate, buy away or if you are a fan of small, okay peanuts then look no more, you have found your peanut utopia.Otherwise, keep on looking...."

1,"Beware item # is wrong, description is wrong, do not oeder unless you want dummy knob in polished brass, not antique."
2,"I have always thought I was a ""spiritual"" person, but this book is a real eye-opener. I love to read and I'd highly recommend this book for those searching for true spirituality and happiness in their lives. He presents his case for ""living in the now"" and just what that means to him. Although it's not excactly a new concept, the wisdom he imparts is priceless. Great read!"
2,"This is a good fryer and it worked well the few times we used it. We wound up getting rid of it because we found it difficult to store because we did not use it on a daily or even weekly basis. So we had to change the oils which got expensive and again, we had space considerations. IF you have space and you use deep friers often, this was a great unit."
2,"The second I pressed play on this cd I was assaulted with a huge battalion of sound. This (to me) is a sign of a cd I'm goin to listen to for a while. While I do agree with some people when they say that the drums are quite weak most of the time and the vocals leave much to be desired, the important thing is that this cd may very well make your nana explode if played loud enough"
1,"I was reluctant to purchase scent diffuser online, but did, based on the reviews, which were unanimous. There isn't much sense in reviewing a product whose appeal depends on personal taste. I wanted, however, to correct the impression that the scent is pleasant and likeable by default, i.e., has a very broad appeal. I certainly disagree.Lesson learned."
1,I was very disappointed with this listenandlive title. All the advice and tips are so obvious and just statements of common sense. In fact many things seem contrived and the advice given does not seem practical at all. A lot of it is obsolete like the chapter about emails.
1,"I bought this book out of curiosity rather than as a teaching guide as I already play the piano to grade 8 (ABRSM).I wish I had not bothered and kept my 14.99. The book is written by a dummy for dummies or more aptly by a moron for morons. The incessant attempt at humour is offputting from the start and the content is disjointed and lacks any conceptual ideas of what music and the piano is really about.The CD accompanying the book is a joke, and if this is an example of the author's musical skill I shudder to think what else he has produced. The irritating keyboard rhythms and styles are a throw back to the Bontempi school of music.IMO this book is pants and is not worthy to carry the name Piano in its title. Save your money and don't buy it, there are lots of other very good ""easy books"" on teaching beginners the piano."
2,"This watch is even better than I had hoped for!! It's just the right size, nice and sporty. It probably has more features than I'll ever need. Love the color, it's light weight. I've worn it to go swimming, give the kids a bath, and to garden. As a mother of two kids 1 & 2, I need a watch that will hold up and this is doing the trick!!"
2,"I am typing this review on my new kensington pilotboard. it is a very nice keyboard, and I love it. the forward/back buttons next to the mouse wheel are very nice, and incredibly useful! (I hate having to go up to the top of my browser to go back) a wonderful keyboard."
1,"This thermometer registers temperature based on a metalic coil on the back of the unit. Mine read 4 to 7 degrees to low. The humidity indicator, as others have commented, simply doesn't work.Otherwise, it was an attractive ornament.I just threw it in the trash.If you want to know the temperature, I recommend the dual mercury thermometer for $10, including prime shipping, Reed MM2 Max-Min Analog Thermometer, -40 to 120 Degrees F.You can't see it across the yard, but it's accurate."
2,"This is a rare album. Rare in two different ways. Rare because you probably won't find it very easily if you ever want to pick up a copy, and secondly, it is one of the most incredible and creative pop/rock albums I've ever heard. And for pop music, ""incredible"" and ""creative"" in the same sentence is quite rare. Paul Alan has crafted sincere lyrics, passionate vocals and crazy catchy melodies that are much more rewarding than most of current radio. Honestly, this is one of those albums which will have you singing with every song. That is, if you enjoy singing along to music. A great CD for cruising the highway. Its a pop record with intelligence and thoughtful storytelling."
1,The horn was delivered bent (bought from BikeWorldUSA) on the Flare and the Chrome was flaking along the length of the horn. The hardware to connect the horn to the bike is very very low quality and does not allow you to lock in the direction of the horn securely. Just pay the extra $5-10 at your local bike shop for a higher quality one. I am.
2,"I like this cd very much, infact i bought one but it got scratched so i got another one. The only problem with this cd is that it doesnt have as very good as beats as songs like ""Fight For Your Right"" and ""Time To Get Ill"" but it is still a good cd."
2,"This is a great album. It's like Sigur Ros filtered through Pet Sounds. However, track 10 is so irritatingly horrible, that I can only give the album a 4. Track 10 is purely self-indulgent garbage that, if a person doesn't stop immediately after song 9, will ruin the great mood the entire album puts him or her in."
1,"I used bel radar detectors for years and always considered them the best but the last few I have purchased from them have had issues and bel does not support their products. I have a rx65 and the laser constantly goes off for no reason and the pop alert sounds every morning if the temperature is below 20 degrees. I called bel and they gave me the run around and every excuse in the book why they could not fix the problem and how they would need to charge me a fee of the problem was not actually a problem if i was to send it in for a ""check up"".Well they just lost a 15 year customer, never again. I would look elsewhere since bel quality and support has taken a nosedive the past few years.They actually told me to just turn off POP and laser to ""fix"" the problem."
2,"It was cool seeing this movie in the theater. Better than ""Gran Torino"" you ask? I don't know, I haven't seen it yet. I'd like to, but ""like to"" only works in horseshoes and hand grenades. And does anyone else think it would be cool to see ""Growing Out"" in 3-D like that Valentine movie? Sign me up for that."

1,"This thin book is very easy to carry anywhere but the content of the book is not really satisfactory. I had to buy another similar book to understand some parts of this book. The problem exerciseparts are good. They have some good problems but when I get stuck on a problem, I had to open a different book to review before going on to a next problem. This book seems to assume that the most readers of this book already know what this book is talking about. This book may be suitable for those who already have enough knowledge on the theory and want to review and refresh the knowledge that they already had before."
2,"This product does deliver on the feeling of fullness and long-lasting satisfaction (with 6 grams of fiber) in under 100 calories. It is certainly no McDonalds shake - tastes a bit gritty and has a coffee-flavor somehow. But it is great to travel with and grab and go if you don't have time to eat. If you compare this to those little 100 calorie snack-type items, this product is far superior in that you are not starving the minute to finish it. The positive side of the taste profile is that your kids won't drink them and leave you with nothing healthy to eat!!!!!"
2,"Love this movie ever since I first saw it on TV in 1972 and it scared me silly, I had nightmares for weeks (I had a bed not unlike the one used in that motel room scene with Cornel Wilde). Needless to say, I don't sleep in beds like that anymore!Haven't seen this movie in decades, so naturally I was pleased when I got this DVD: very good transfer (I would have accepted less). Exactly how I remembered it, scene for scene. True, it's not a masterpiece but it is sheer perfection when it comes to this type of movie. Have I mentioned that I absolutely love this movie? And now that I've got my own copy I can watch and enjoy it anytime I want. It's definitely a keeper!"
1,"Being both a Beegie Adair and a Cole Porter fan I was eagerly anticipating the arrival of this CD, but would have to say it is, to my taste, the weakest of her works. I've tried to think why, and believe it is a conflict between a great instrumentalist and a great lyricist, indeed poet. Porter's genius was in his poetry, set to catchy tunes.In this CD, Beegie seems to run rampant with the music to the point that one can't follow the lyrics, either in your head or aloud. It seems a bit egotistical to me to do so, and I would compare this CD with her wonderful ""I'll Take Romance,: where Beegie seems to worship the songs she plays. In ""Dream Dancing,"" it's more of a battle.The final track ""Begin the Beguine"" is just painful, a slow funeral dirge of a song that can be a great self proclamation.Not recommended."
1,"Sometimes there is a reason a book doesn't sell well. At first, I was pleased with the book. The language is well-spoken and poetic as a young boy looks up at the birds in the sky. However I was jolted when, in the middle of the book, the author said that people who didn't like the birds had poisoned them with bitter seed.....and there was the depressing and graphic picture of 30 dead birds. I didn't think it was suitable for children. After thinking about it, I decided to cut that page out of the book. Now my daughter enjoys the story, and so do I."

2,I'm a sucker for my bike and I had to rub it on real hard for a long time. But other than requiring some work to get the blue off it's the best polish for blued Harley pipes that I ever tried. Nothing else even comes close. It actually removed ALL the blue without scratching my pipes and it is so much cheaper than a new set of pipes. The label says if it does not work they will give you back your money. Clever!
2,"Over the years I have struggled with a number of print servers for my home networks. This baby is the bomb! I had it up and running in under 5 minutes from the time I opened the box! I loved it so much, I justed ordered a second to replace a balky print server I have at another house. When you set it up, the wizard will ask if you want to change the print server settings. Click yes and select static IP and not DHCP (just click the radio button, don't change the IP address shown). I highly recommend!"
2,Great training in VFX! Get ready to buckle up and learn an amazing product. (intermediate to advanced learning curve) {used with mac 10.5) haven't worked with this product in SL yet.
2,"This item was reasonably priced as compared to similar functionality in local stores. Things I like are:1. It's lined so it doesn't feel clammy when you wear it.2. The water-proof outer seems like it will hold up well to abrasion.3. The hood covers your face, but still allows good vision.4. It fits well over a sweat-suit. I ordered a ""large"", I am ~190lbs with a ~41"" chest and 32 inch inseam. It is the perfect size for me.5. This suit is really waterproof. You could stand in the shower and stay dry.Things to consider:Your feet will still be vulnerable to getting wet. If that matters, some sort of rain cover would still be a good idea."

2,"I bought this for my 99 year old grandmother. Her bathtub is made strangely and it was difficult to find a place that it could actually be attached. And when I did find a place to attach it, it wasn't exactly where we wanted it ... BUT having said all of that... it works well. She now has stability while getting in and out of the bathtubThe equipment itself is very easy to attach - you just place it over the edge of the tub and then tighten it. My Grandmother's tub is a decorative one though and it was too wide for the bar to fit over the edge. Bit there was a place in the back of the tub where the decorative lip was smaller and I was able to attach it there"
2,love this book as english is`not my first language.kids love the book. everybody. it is really useful and interesting. im so happy with it. yeah!
2,"This book is simply the best novel I have read in many years. Most multi-generational novels cannot sustain the same level of interest and excellence each time period. Middlesex grabbed me from the start, and got better as it went on. It's beautifully written and emotionally gripping. I read lots of novels in hopes of getting into a book like this every ten years or so. I cannot say enough about this book. Whether your taste is for great literature or page-turners that won't let go, this book is for you. I cannot recommend it more highly. I'd say more, but I don't want to give away any of the good stuff!"
2,"I enjoyed reading this book greatly, in fact I read the book in two days, could not put it down. Ms. Isaacs makes you forget that this is just a book. The characters become part of your world,I had to keep reminding myself that it was okay how the story ended it's just a book, yet she made me care so much for the characters that I worried how they would cope with the book's ending. The ending for me was upsetting but it also made me think- made me examine my beliefs on relationships, marriage. I keep going back over parts of the book trying to really understand the character's thinking, why they did what they did, like if I could find that clue that would change the ending - make it all better-prevent the sadness that's to follow I gladly would. That's how much Ms. Isaacs had me caring for these fictional characters lives. Read it."
1,"I'll start by saying ""you get what you pay for"". Except for a few parts, it's totally made of plastic, so the depth gauge didn't stay secured. As a result, I got uneven depth routes. The screws on the bottom of the three metal posts vibrated loose mid route. You can't tighten them without fear of cracking the plastic base (which I did -- and I didn't over tighten either). Once the base cracked at the screws, it's done. It's on it's way to recycling! Great idea, but bad design."
1,"While I agree with the previous author regarding the importance of Die Strasse/The Street as an important work of 1920s German cinema, this print is the worst one that I have ever seen. It looks like a fifth generation video recorded on a DVD-R disc. Several scenes are incomplete, and the important scene in which a streetwalker turns into a skeleton is missing. That scene is also missing from a previously released video version. Save your money and wait for a restored version."
2,"hahaha i am the first to write a review, this cd, is very hype. i will always listen to it. the best song is of course, who dat, but most songs are great"
1,". . . so I it's hard for me to understand the angst and humor of 20 somethings. Perhaps that's why I found this show's freshman year so disappointing. That said, the next two seasons of ""Community"" have been very entertaining.But back to Season 1: I discovered ""Community"" with Season 3's Christmas special, which was clever, entertaining, and beautifully performed. The rest of that year remained high quality. Of course, I bought Seasons 1 and 2 the moment they came down in price. Sadly, I found the first half of Season 1 to be mean spirited and a punishment to watch. The second half of the season showed a mellowing, but was pretty lackluster. The exception was ""Modern Warfare,"" a brilliant paintball-parody on war films."
2,"This film never received the attention it deserved. Jack Nicholson and Meryl Streep both have fine performances, but Nicholson's stands out as he demonstrates a range of emotion and pathos not seen in his other work. The cinemaphotography and lighting as he drifts from the dreary reality of life on the streets to his inner world of neurotic fears, joys, and memories is fantastic. You will not forget this movie."
1,"What an idiot I was to buy this POS game. Koei adds so very little new material to the Dynasty Warrior 3 game and all the changes to the game engine are FOR THE WORSE. The difficulty is revved up so much that my maxed Wei Yan lasted 5 minutes on hard mode on You Ting. But fortunetly Koei has added a Very Hard difficulty level beyond this????? Also many of the new things added involve your body guards and are thus completely useless because your body guards die instantly on any difficulty setting and wont get stronger unless they survive an entire level. Also in response to the many complaints about super archers, Koei has wisely responded by making enemy archers faster, more acurate and more damaging! Party on fanboys!"
1,"When I purchased this gage, the product description said it would fit my 98 f150. When I attempted to use it, there was no schader valve fitting for my truck. This may be a great tool, but I've got to buy an adapter so I can use it. When you buy from amazon.com you better be sure before you pay. This is my first and last purchase from amazon.com, in the future I'll go somewhere so I can see what I'm buying, like Sears."
2,"I am glad I read this. I tend to usually not get into reading plays, but I did enjoy this one. It is haunting and is not a feel-good read, much like the movie. However, there are some lines in this that just grab you. The constant question of what defines love, sex, and happiness is very thought-provoking. Can love just stop in a single moment?"
1,The book is a slow read only because it is full of so much detail mainly about the characters. I am about half way through and it is reminiscent of Water for Elephants so far. Well I have now finished and let me just say this is the weirdest book I have ever read. It is so unbelievable in parts it makes the story difficult to read. Its saving grace is that it is totally unlike anything else out there. It took some type of imagination to conjure this up. I would not read it again and cannot see how it was a National Book Award finalist.
2,"When your nose lines up with the average size man's armpit, you quickly realize how important a man's smell can be. That's why I wear Mambo. I splash a little on the top of my head and anytime someone leans over to tie his shoe or pick a nickel up off the street, I treat them to what I consider nature's second best stink, Mambo."
2,I can not praise Miss Read too much. I am amused and delighted by her wonderful characters and village troubles and triumphs.
2,"The hitch fits my Dodge pick up truck. It is not the one on the picture. It is a much cheaper one the one I ordered, according to the photo, but it fits and works properly. I did not return it because I needed it that weekend. Now, I will not waste anymore time on it. When I compared the prices of the similar ones on the internet, I paid a fair price for it. No great bargain or sale price."
1,"Be sure to measure your arm before purchasing... it's annoying to receive the unit with the Standard Adult Arm Cuff (fits arms 9 to 13 inches around) and find out I have to order a larger arm cuff!Don't bother calling Omron ""Customer Service"" at 1-800-634-4350... just a typical big company voice mail hell! It even tells you to call another number to order the piece...My 1 Star rating is only for the ordering information not provided and Omrons ""customer service"""
2,"It is durable, beautiful and goes from everyday to formal dining easily. I love how it feels and how it handles everything I put it through. Finally, pretty dishes that are strong and light!"
1,this item did arrive with a cracked nipple and it leaks when ever you drink from it every time yeah.
2,"I found this interview fascinating. There is a wonderful, simple message in Mr. Rawat's words and that is peace is possible. That this gift exists is a joy for a person's heart, for my heart it is. I have shared this interview with many of my friends."
1,I got both rejuvanator and cleaner and followed instructions. This doesn't work for Ethan Allen fine very soft leather couch. After 24h of application of rejuvanator the sofa was really sticky I used the leatherique cleaner that didn't solve the problem (all the dust was vissible) plus I noticed it was stripping the color (burgundy). The leather became matte stiff.Not only it didn't take off stains but it damaged the protective finish and my sofa looks older than before application. It is ugly faded and course to the feel. I really regret that buy.
1,"The only thing close to DMB about this album is the TITLE.Cheaply produced album, uncatchy, uninspiring.It's a mockery to all DMB fans around the world.I'm not sure that there would be next album.Probably Dave is aiming for a second solo album, gloomier than the first.."
2,"Just picked this album up yesterday (the release date) and gave it a few listens through. I was expecting a studio album that was more finely honed than white pepper and chocolate and cheese. I was mistaken, but definetely not disappointed. This will please any ween fan, as it seems to be a meshing of the feel of mollusk and pure guava. (If you can give any ween album a ""feel"" as all the songs are very diverse) Anyways, I had heard a few of the songs live (Zoloft, fancy pants, ect.) from the 2/7 trenton show, and enjoyed the rest as well. Anyways, pick up this album if you have even a remote interest in this band. It holds appeal to anyone from new listeners to avid members of the cult of the boognish."
1,"PROS:-Good looking watch.-Fairly easy to use.-Love the fact that the watch face is twisted to make viewing it while I run easier.-The watch's wrist band held up well, unlike the Swiss Army watches I've had crack on me.CONS:-After only a month's use, the plasic wrap that encases the watch itself started to detach and warp. It appears as though it was simply glued to the metal part of the watch. It's now so warped that it looks terrible and makes it difficult to press the buttons along the side.-At 18 months, the watch has bugun to collect moisture inside. From diving deeper than its 100M rating, you ask? No, from sweat and shower water. The digital display is now failing and I'll soon have to throw the watch away like a piece of trash. That's just unnaceptable, Nike."
1,"The E550 is a good camera and this lens does do a good job of zooming in on the subject but due to the way the camera and lens are designed, you must have the camera's zoom fully extended in order to use this tele lens. So this means if the subject is moving around a lot, such as my daughter playing soccer, you will miss the shots where the action has moved to close to you because you can't zoom out. As long as the action remains at some distance to you than this zoom lens is useful. I unfortunately have too many ruined shots because the action moved too close and their heads get cut off, etc.Another negative is that the viewfinder doesn't show the zoomed in image, you must use the lcd screen to frame a shot, which can be difficult in bright sunlight."
1,"From the discription of the product, I expected the glow to be as brilliant as the Glow in the Dark Xtreme Stars. But they were not. They are just sitting in a drawer in my son's room."
2,This movie is a perky movie about a teenager going to Harvard to get her boyfriend to like her again. This was a movie I think was really good and happy it was #1! It deserved it!
1,"I agree with a previous review---something about the accolades is biased here (consider the repeating phrases).This does not produce great popcorn. I bought the unit with the special Wabash popcorn pouches touted to have won awards. I have used several, and the popcorn is not crisp, but is chewy, not particularly special in flavor, and full of saturated fat because of the coconut oil blend in the pouches.The unit is flimsy, prone to bending, and IMO does not produce popcorn as good as Popsecret Homestyle or Orville's Movie Theater microwave popcorn.Avoid this item! Within weeks I had to dispose of it."
1,"Book came with torn cover, felt cheated. This should be mentioned at point of sale to enable buyer make decision."
2,"I found this product to be very good, and I have used one for almost a year. Very easy to set up and use; cables are nice and long - they provide a needed ""extension cord"" for my setup, no extra charge! ;-) I did find that the product has trouble with the IBM Thinkpad laptop mouse port, in that I cannot share the mouse between both computers attached to the unit. This was a documented known limitation, however, so I can't find too much fault with it. Would have been nice to know before purchase, though.Overall, love it, and love the keyboard shortcut for switching computers! A great buy."
1,"This is a rotten product. Only one port works consistently, while the other three respond intermittently. Save yourself some frustration and spend a little more money on something better."
1,"Bought this video card some 3 months ago to replace the existing card on my Dell PC. The fan on the card started to make noise two weeks ago. The noise level got worse over time. Finally, it became unberable so I took it off my PC. Tried to contact the manufacturer without success. An inexpensive card but unreliable - avoid it."
2,I wanted a bedside phone with a lighted caller ID hard to find.with alarm and raido has everythink I was lookin for.
1,All the vitamins were broken!! Great product and price but not if they are broken! Inspect your bottle on arrival! We didn't find out til we needed to open a new bottle.
2,"I bought the Linksys BEFW11S4 Wireless 4-Port Cable/DSL Router online from amazon.com. ... It comes with an instruction leaflet (folds out like a map) and a startup CD. To illustrate how easy it is to install, I never used the CD at ALL. It took me about 15 minutes to install (using the leaflet as a guide) on my primary computer, which already has a NIC Card for my cable modem. Easy Web Interface to configure, saved setting, and done. It took me another 15 minutes to setup my second computer (laptop) with a wireless card. All I had to do is enter my network name from the Primary computer setup and BAM...I was cruising all over the house, back porch, yard. Signal strength stayed at ""excellent"" where ever I went. This is a winner...now I don't have to wrestle with the kids to get online! 2000 square foot Raised Ranch, Primary Computer with Router sits on bottom level of the house, Router sits at desktop level..works like a charm."
2,"Wow, The music is fine, the dances are great, the story could be better, but over all was a fun movie, with a little bit of love and gansters rappers..."
1,"I hate to say this about such an amazing show, but unless you can find it for $19.95 or less, do not buy it. This season does not have an out-takes feature.No comedy on TV should release a DVD without a bloopers reel. Scrubs has always been known for the best bloopers. It's why many of us shell out $25-$30 for the season as soon as it hits the shelves. Interviews with the cast and crew are only valuable to the cast and crew, and deleted scenes are useful to remind the writers that you care about them. But the audience wants to be entertained with more than what we can see on Comedy Central in a few months. Seriously, the show is in syndication now, and the value of the actual episodes goes way south after that.Give me more to make me laugh."
1,"I was very disappointed by my first visit to the Pennyfoot. This is 12th in the series and the author must be ready to ""get rid"" of the characters and it shows. The plot is rushed and contrived and the characters were stereotypes one and all. Perhaps if I had been following the series through several books I would have felt differently. Recommend not purchasing, instead borrow from library."
2,This is a great live show that really does the trick. The band is jamming out great tunes from their peak period and that's good enough for me. it's the original band here and that band has reformed to still bring great songs to your ears. This is what good musicianship sounds like in hard rock filled with melody to spare. All the hits are on here too. At least the live versions of them.
2,Too many times things are easy to make but have no taste. Everything I have made out of this book has been great. There are no strange foods to purchase. Everything can be found at your local grocery store. I can't wait for more cookbooks from Rachel.
2,I'm a professional general and electrical contractor and I use and abuse my tools every day. The new Dewalt 7.2v cordless screwdriver is one of the most exciting tools I've used in a long time. It is extremely powerful yet gives you precise control to drive screws into a variety of materials. I own several other brands of cordless screwdrivers but this one is hands down my favorite!
2,"This book is thorough, comprehensive, readable, and sensible. The author is an expert who had been there doing hospital security work, and it shows."
1,"What kind of author thinks pounding little kids with objects is a good idea? The usual ""beat your children with a rod"" stuff is in this little pamphlet, as if we needed more reminding of Old Testament brutality like whippings and stonings. It seems any unqualified person can put words on paper and sell them to a violence-sodden public, people looking for ways to take out their disappointment and rage on the most vulnerable, the ""least of these"": little children. I suggest you pass on this book, and read some good non-violent parenting books by Sears, Whitehurst, Granju, O'Mara, and La Leche League. It's worth remembering that Jesus never advocated hitting children. Christ shows us a new way to relate to each other, out of forgiveness and love. Reading the New Testament with open eyes and heart could help a lot of people get away from the idea that violence solves problems. Violence just begets violence. It was the way of Solomon and it didn't work back then either."
1,"The Baby Einstein series has a few engaging videos for infants that don't have education in mind, and, they have this video that has education in mind but is not very entertaining. I applaud the courage to try this concept in America, and I believe it started a whole new trend in baby videos. I thank Julie Clark for that, although I with my youngest, I've foregone an introduction to the Baby Einstein videos after trying them with my 2 year old.I also don't believe in putting children in front of the television at the suggested age group. An infants eyesight doesn't develop until 4 months old, and this should have been taken into consideration in its making and marketing. With all the newer videos that just came out, like the Baby Know-It-All series (absolute favorites for both toddlers) and Bilingual Baby's more targeted language associations, I find that Baby Einstein is not a great buy."
2,"I'm always afraid that a TV series will get stale and fizzle out, but House has not done so. The writing is great, the acting is great, and the show keeps me coming back for more."
2,"With so many vocalist out there, its difficult to fine an artist so rare and new. Maysa Leak makes it look easy. Clearly she captures vocal as if it was a band instrument. Those wanting to become singing should start by listening to this cd. Out of the Blue is another chapter in Vocals 101. Plain and simple, Maysa can sang!!! I love that on this cd, she explores her playful side with ""Mr.So Damn Fine"". While still relaxing her fans with ""Everything and Blue Horizon"". I actually can feel each note, crescendo, and pulse. This artist that clearly loves to sing. Maysa's voice is like a painting on a canvas. The colors and textures are bright, deep, and full of emotions. The title track ""Out of the Blue"" take you back to what music is suppose to be about. ""Creative, fun and free"" Oh, and the Earth Wind and Fire cut took me way back. Thank you Maysa, for showing us how it should be done."
2,"1971 album on CD ! Rosetta is great. As the lead singer of The Orlons I always loved her voice. They were my favorite girl group. This CD has super versions of River Deep Mountain High,Stoned Love,Remember Me,I Heard It Through The Grapevine,and Every Little Bit Hurts. Motown classics done well."
1,"Thought I'd give the new service a try, but found two major strikes against it. Okay, three. First, there is no place to provide feedback on the Unbox service itself. Second, I have Windows 2000 and can not load the Unbox player. Third, the Ipod with Video is not one of the devices I can transfer videos to. Until these items are addressed, I'm afraid for me that Unbox is three strikes and out. NBC was foolish to dump iTunes in favor of this service given these limitations."
1,"With the cover and description of this movie was 'hyped', because the movie was rated a 2 star......boring!"
2,"I highly recomment these earings. They are so pretty and look great with everything. They are light, which I like and well made. The stone looks just like the picture, not to dark or light. I love ordering with Amazon because the service is great and they care about the customer. I noticed a review that said they fell apart, but my pair is very well made. I have ordered several more earings, just might be my new hobby. The prices are very good and delivery was quick. Thanks Amazon!"
2,"This is the last show with ""Barney and the Backyard Gang."" This show has lots of songs, and it is very good. The kids go to a movie studio and pretend to put on a show with Barney. They do a commercial for cereal, put on a puppet show, paint their faces, pretend to travel to an island, and rock and roll! The kids also meet some new friends, including Kathy--played by Lauren King, who stays with Barney & Friends until 1995. This show has a lot of songs, and it will keep your child's attention very well. It includes the songs: Apples and Bananas, Six Little Ducks, Me and My Teddy, and Good Manners. I recommend this for all Barney lovers!"
2,"A terrific, whimsical, sensitive and sensual look at growing up. In Sam Joyce created a stand-in for every thoughtful boy. In Alice and Linda he made icons of the unattainable. And in the creature herself...well, as others have said, as the book progresses what she is becomes less important than the effect of her existence on Sam's world.Carnal when it needs to be, sweetly trepidatious the rest of the time--this book speaks volumes about expectations, relationships, and what is lost as we arrow through time.Actually reminds me a lot of The Perks of Being a Wallflower--although it's definitely more whimsical and sensual. Funny to use those words in the same sentence to describe any novel.Definitely recommended."
1,"A young boy named Bertie has an unhealthy fixation on the color BLUE. He soon extends this obsession to a pet. We witness imaginative play where Bertie hallucinates that he is petting, feeding, and walking his blue dog, even dragging the leash and collar along the ground. But since ""pretend dogs don't fetch sticks,"" Bertie must take his psychosis to the next level: now he *is* a blue dog. He barks like a dog, eats sticks, even scratches himself!Act II reveals Bertie to be the lucky recipient of a real dog. Yet he almost sinks into depression--sobbing into his hands and subsequently curling up into the fetal position--when it turns out to be a beautiful, spotted, black and white (but not BLUE) dog.Thankfully, a sudden inspiration allows the dog to be BLUE in name if nothing else, and everyone lived happily ever after. Too little, too late."
1,"Written in 1921, its no longer copyrighted. No need to buy it when you can download it free.In fact, the printing I received seems to be a poorly formatted PDF printout of an older scanned copy (in a fancy binding). It seems to include some underlining and comments from the owner of the original book.I felt a little cheated by the publisher - Bibliolife."
2,"The title is designed to catch your attention, as I gave it 5 stars anyway. I agree with most of the comments that follow. It is not his best album (if only because he hasn't got his best band) but it is one of his most ambitious, most incoherent, most underrated pieces of music.OK, the film doesn't look too good after all those years, and let's not kid ourselves into thinking Zappa was a great film producer as well, but BOY! He does produce some magical moments here: the Strictly Genteel finale, the She painted up her face sequence, Magic Fingers, Tuna sandwich etc, the tunes just keep on coming. If you buy one Zappa cd do not buy this. Of you buy five, this one must be included."
1,"While the story, about Song Jiang, one of the 36 main heroes of the Chinese classic ""Water Margins"" (aka Band of Brothers), is okay and the acting by Loletta Lee and Wu Ma passable, the video and audio quality of this DVD-R is poor. Also because it's DVD-R, it may not play well on some stand-alone DVD players. Unless you're a Loletta fan, this is a pass."
1,"Ive bought this test twice now and both times they didn't work. The first time there was an error message and the second time there was a see leaflet message. A complete waste of money, the regular ept test is much more reliable."
1,"I've owned 3 pairs of ""The Plug"" over the last several years and was always impressed with the good performance. I bought a set for my wife this month and what is being sold as ""The Plug"" today is in no way the same as what it was previously. Today's incarnation of ""The Plug"" is substantially less expensive than in the past and it shows in every way. I compared these side-by-side with my 2 year old pair of ""The Plug"" and both the build quality and the sound quality are far inferior on today's version. In particular the sound is atrocious. They are very tinny, lack dynamic range, balance and definition. I wouldn't take a pair if they were given to me. Save your money."
2,"ordered this bush at the end of May in zone 8, I will post a picture after the sun comes up. The bush even made it through our horrible summer."
1,"The book ""Tortilla Curtain"" deals with an interesting conflict between immigrants and upper middle class-Americans, but it is written in a boring way, because there are too many details and the story is too long. It has no real climax or structure and because of that, the story seems to be endless. Another aspect is that the plot is exaggerated and surrealistic, although the depiction of two completely different worlds is very good.All in all it is difficult for the reader to see the whole context, because of too many unimportant details."
2,"i tore through this book in about 4 hours, but came away very impressed. what really is dazzling is the compassion and tenderness the author feels for her patients."
2,"This is an excellent book on finishes. While some of it is things that ""everyone knows"" there are a lot of good techniques and it is particularly valuable when starting a project that is going to be finished using different techniques than you are used to. It is a great reference and useful to everyone from the beginner (although a little daunting) to the experienced. I would have given it a 5 star rating but for the need to look in several different sections for information and the index while adequate is not really as good as it should be."
2,"The main reason in my mind to buy this cd are the 2 tracks from Les Contes d'Hoffmann and Lakme sung by the wonderful Edita Gruberova. The 1st track is playful, funny, the 2nd breathtaking for her high notes and heartbreaking. A lesser reason is for Anna Moffo's Caro Nome from Rigoletto, the cadenza at the end is like nothing you've ever heard! Even if you don't know much about opera, this is an enjoyable cd. Cheap, too!"
2,"I purchased a new backgammon set and it arrived in perfect condition. The only problem I had was the black pieces. They were somehow discolored on every one. This problem was not present on the white. Everytime I play it the black pieces bother me. I would like instructions on getting another set of black pieces. I feel that I should not have to pay since this set was not cheap. Please advise.Thanks,Gary H."
2,"Kritzella!!! Is that you?????If it is, then....let's start a NEW Vegas Show Band! We have to find RICHARD CURTIS (sadly, probably gone)...but that shouldn't stop us. We'll get the old band together and just move on from here. What do you think?PM"
1,This is garbage! The lip of the charger is too tall for the battery to fit. It's useless!
1,"I first starting putting this rack together the moment I got it. Once I really got into it, I thought for sure there were pieces missing. It was not stable at all and swayed if I even touched it, forget putting bikes on it. So I tried screwing the top portion into the wall with the screw and anchor provided. It still was not at all stable and the entire thing came crashing down on me. I've now taken it apart and put it back into a box. I'm going to contact the company and ask for a refund and will never recommend this product to anyone."
1,"These CD's are nothing more than someone reading the lectures in the Textbook and the Workbook, nothing more. I thought that I was buying the Student Audio Program that accompanies the Workbook, which this isn't. I suppose that someone might like listening to someone just speak the language, but that is all this is. You might as well turn on the television."
2,I originally read the entire series online as it was being posted week after week. I was hooked and when it went to print I had to have my own. A very interesting take on the Zombie theme. I was highly amused.
2,"Gregor The Overlander was a fun and lightweight read. I enjoyed the tale of Gregor and his little sister Boots as they both ventured the Underland. Plus it was neat to read Suzanne Collins first ever major published book. I definitely recommend it to those in search of a fun ride filled with adventure, action and suspense."
2,"I bought this at Target 2 years ago only because it was the only fat separator in stock, and I needed it immediately. I wanted something simpler and cheaper, since I only use it once a month or so. That said, I LOVE it! I'm so happy to have it- it is easy to use, and it goes through the dishwasher every time with no issues. The plunger is a great addition to traditional separators, and the raised lip at the front ensures easy pouring, even when it is nearly full."
2,"I just finished reading this book of poems and I am a father of a boy and a girl. The prayers are honest and filled with love. I have read some to both children who are 13 and 12. The prayers touch the hearts of all of us. They speak to everyone, of any age or gender."
2,"This was one of my favorite books when I was a child. I loved the story tremendously, and the illustrations were mesmorizing. It always would put me in the mood for Thanksgiving, any time of year! I still read it today, and the pictures bring me back to a wonderful time. All of Harry Devlin's books are fantastic...and the Cranberry series is a must for children of all ages."
1,"You will not enjoy this game unless you are a conniseur of old movies ... make that old ""MGM"" movies. Actually, this game is so boring I don't think anyone at all would have fun with it. Save your money or put it towards one of the other DVD movie games!"
2,"Like other reviews have said, this fan is quite powerful for its size. Even the lowest setting moves more air than a lot of other fans I've tried.This fan also lasts a long time. I have owned one for five years that still works great. During the summers, it is on in my bedroom constantly and I am amazed that it has held up this long.With that said, it is noisy. Not in a deafening roar sense, but loud enough that you'll notice it if it is in the room with you. Still, I like the noise. When I'm sleeping, it offers a good amount of white noise that helps me sleep.For the price, an excellent fan."
1,"This had no redeeming value for me what so ever. Good luck finding it for anyone else out there., it ain't secxy that's for sure. a bit fo eye candy at very best."
2,"I became aware of the Baby Q when on a recent vacation trip with friends who had one they brought along. It is the perfect size for taking with you or just using at home, especially if you are barbecuing for 1 or 2 up to 6 people. I use it mostly for myself, I love it's small size, and ease of use. Does a perfect job. Get the stand that goes with it. It folds flat for transport and is just great for use with the grill anywhere."
2,"This Asheville based group, is anything but small-town. Their music, which is a combination of sampling, recorded vocals and computer magic is delight to the ears. I highly recommend!"
1,"I am not sure if it was just the hired help for Christmas or if the tech support team is actually as incapable as my experience proved to be. My tech support person wouldn't release a confirmation number for me until after over an hour of waiting for him to put me on hold at least seven times while he continually attempted to get bad counsel from some mysterious person. I eventually asked him to get tier 2 tech support on the phone for me as I was tired of this circus act... I was denied. I was then put on hold again before being told that someone else would call me within a day... this has not yet happened. I would have purchased an HP wireless laser for Christmas instead however, they stopped making them... only deskjets... why, HP? Why??!!"
2,"This is the best coffee maker that I have used/owned. If you are looking for a real coffee maker (not keurig), than this is one of your best options. Definitely the best option at this price point.All stainless steel construction, except for the base and the handle, but these parts are not connected to the brewing system or carafe.The coffee does not burn when left on for hours at a time, like with a glass carafe on a burner.Easy to clean.It's a bit more work to load it than other coffee makers, but its worth it."

2,hi this is a great returns cartoon from 1989 in dvd whit more extra rare!6 dvd whit over 32 episode in color high from remenbere the first season!if youlove ghostbusters cach!!
2,"After a less than sensational season 13 (I enjoyed the one episode but it wasn't one of their best), Frost is back on top. Fans will not be disappointed with season 14, wonderful plots and acting. The only ""complaint"" I have is that there were only 3 episodes (Note: it has subtitles, yeah!)"
1,"She makes many mistakes in this book, and she is very disespectfull in my mind by posting the autopsy photo."
2,"I have never bought a bra without trying it on first, but the reviews were so good for this one that I took a chance. I am so glad I did! This is by far the best bra I've ever owned. It's extremely comfortable and fits perfectly. It's very pretty on, but still gives great support. The thickness is just perfect and the straps have never fallen off my shoulders. I just ordered another one because now I don't want to wear any of my other bras."
2,I bought this movie for my husband. We both watched it and it is a very good movie. I am happy with this dvd.
1,"These ""authors"" have collected work, pictures and words by many different artists and put them onto a CD, without permission of the artists and owners of the work. My work is some of that that is included.All of these projects and many more are freely available at the sculpey site - don't waste your money.Don't be misled by the positive reviews that are posted, here... the ""author"" seems to find his most inventive and imaginative phrasing when describing his own books.Zig"
1,"NIGHT CREATURE is one of those trademark late 70s movies that moves so slow it becomes uncomfortable waiting for something to happen. And even when it does, it is so poorly filmed and edited, you don't really see much of what's going on. Add the wearisome storyline of a great hunter who loves hunting more than his two daughters, bring them together on a deserted island with a deadly black leopard and talk the audience to death. That's basically all NIGHT CREATURE accomplishes. Donald Pleasance is ludicrously inept as Axel McGregor, who brings the captured leopard to his island to kill it; and Nancy Kwan fares little better as one of his daughters. Dull and tedious, little to recommend."
1,"Unfortunately, I bought each book for my seven year old son. Even he could not believe how ""horrible"" Henry behaved with absolutely NO consequences. One book has Henry singing about hitting an old person on the head with a cane. I am ""horrified"" that these books are published and further shocked they have been endorsed by parents. These books are so deplorable I will not pass along to friends or donate. They will end up in the garbage where they belong. Reckless content pretty much sums it up. Oh, I looked at the author's photo and let's just say I wasn't surprised."
2,I purchased these shoe trees for my ballroom dance shoes. They are well-made and are high quality. They absorb moisture and odors and keep your shoes from being crushed or misshapen.
2,"Leonx's First Blessing Nativity figurines may be a bit hard to find in stores, but onlineLenox First Blessing Drummer Boythrough Amazon is seems to be readily available. This is a beautiful addition to our family Nativity and one of our 6 year old daughters favorites!Revision 2/20/2010: The availability of many of the Lenox First Blessing figures has become sporadic on Amazon, but when available, Amazon's vendors' prices are competitive (and often lower) than in department stores. If you are seeking a specific Lenox First Blessing figure, click on Amazon's link to notify you when the item is available. I have found no pattern for when they are listed, and it doesn't seem to be just during the Christmas season."
2,this card is great for its price great buy im very happy i saved a lot of money thanks alot
2,"Well I got this CD for Christmas and I am extremely pleased with it. I think CD 1 which is more hard house than trance is the better - mainly for Florian F's Surreal Brazil which is a masterpiece - But still I like the harder feel of this disc. Number 2 is definitely lighter and trancier but gets a bit harder towards the end although it is spoiled at the start by using too many tracks with vocals(I think a definite no-no in trance), but even so there are some gems like Moogwai's Viola. So overall if you like stompier hard house tunes, buy it and listen to CD 1. CD 2 has too many cheesy vocals for me, so if you want good trance, wait for the soon-to-be-released Binary Finary album instead."
2,"It's refreshing to watch a movie that is creative, heartwarming and even a little sci-fi all in one. Especially after watching a movie like Ted a few days before. It's like that breath of fresh air you take in after holding your breath in a disgusting port-a-potty. I'll def see this movie again!"
1,"Me: Hey fred, I have some good newsFred:What? Im running out of money and I need it badly, so you helped me stqay back in my gold mansion where I can live lavishly by destroying metal?Me: NO, But I saved 100 dollars on my car insurance by switching to Geico!Speaking of which, Geffen wants your money. Don't give it to them."
2,"This knife is exceptionally well designed. The textured handle provides a good grip, and it is very light for its size, which is just about perfect. This is the best pocket knife I've ever owned or ever seen.Gregg Morris"
1,I received the Revereware seven piece set for Christmas. I've used the frying pan maybe four times. It warped. The current pans are not the same quality they were 15 years ago. The stainless steel is not as thick and the copper bottoms look painted on. I'm afraid to give them a good scrubbing for fear of scrubbing the copper right off. The pans are also not made in America any more and the poor quality of the pan reflects that. I am disappointed.
1,"This book does not cover the different types of finches & softbills. It is very general information only, on breeding and care of finches & softbills, no help to the person wanting more specific info. on the different types of finches and their care."
1,"This calculator has many good features. Large enough for keys to be easily used, but fits in a shirt pocket. Uses two cheap AAA bstteries with a button battery for memory backup. It has a detailed instruction book, But the MEMORY is next to IMPOSSIBLE to access. The calculator does not even use the word memory, but uses the word list. It goes in to great detail how to manipulate the data in the list, but does not have a store or save and a recall button I spent 2 days trying to figure it out, and finally took it back. The HP9g that I replaced it with was easy to enter and access memory."
1,I HATE the controls in this game it is the worst ive ever experienced. The camera is so hard to control and it bugs the hell out of me! But the game does have some good points i liked the opening movie and the song~hehe! but if i were you i wouldnt waste my money(like i did) on this game~ get resident evil 0 instead!!!!!
2,This book does an excellent job encouraging young children to create a secure financial future for themselves. It sparks interest in the toddlers who were previously bored with the topic of personal financial planning. They'll have their calculators out and be balancing the books in NO TIME!! Great introduction for youngsters.
2,"I found this book quite fascinating, as it touches on a facet of the Cold War very rarely mentioned in the mainstream of history -- the practices of limited (though still dangerous) engagement between the U.S. and Soviet high-seas fleets. Furthermore, it details not only the incidents, but the effect that seemingly remote occurences had on both the Soviet and U.S. leadership. That effect, ultimately led to the establishment of a number of agreements, also detailed in this volume. Interestingly enough, Winkler makes it quite apparent that many of the Soviet diplomats and military officials were quite mindful of the impending failure of the Soviet Union, even in the early 1970s. I would definitely reccomend it if you are interested in Naval or Cold War history, or if for some reason, you want a detailed history of collisions at sea, as found in one of the appendixes."
2,it's really funny spuntenous and glamours even though it shows the simple everyday life of the classic girls next door.
1,"I heard this Rach 2 on public radio today, and was awestruck. I waited for twenty minutes in my driveway to hear who could possibly posses this clumsy sense of rhythm, this ability to make even the most graceful transitions sound forced, this manor of hammering awkwardly at the most beautiful left-hand runs ever composed, and a total -- and I mean complete and utter -- lack of dramatic sensibility. The local NPR station sometimes plays recordings of the local community orchestra; perhaps the no-name soloist from last season?... No, I would have remembered a performance as bad as this...Of course I recognized the name of Kissin when I heard it, famous as it is. However, I am not familiar with the rest of his discography for a simple reason; I only buy discs which are acclaimed critically. Yet, modest as Kissin's reputation is among reviewers, this performance truly shocked me. It really was THAT bad."
2,"I agree with the other positive reviews, so I won't repeat them. I wanted to add that I have small hands, and I really like this knife and the others in the Pro S line I've gotten so far. I can be clumsy, so having a comfortable knife is especially helpful. This particular knife is the one I choose for almost everything except bread, so if I had to choose just one knife, this would be it."
2,"Really slick. Bought for my wife.Nice tight fit for Macbook or similar.Not much room for extras like mouse or power cord, but they can be squeezed in there if necessary.Has held up really well over the 2+ years we've had it."
1,"I really would like a replacement for this spatula...it's WAY too flexible...beyond the necessity to not damage ceramic ware...please, upgrade this unit or quit foisting it upon an unsuspecting public."
2,Just as I ordered. Work perfectly for his practice games. Size wasaccurate. After washing still comfortable.I would recommend to anyone.
2,This book was the first book I read on JSP pages. Thank God. The book is very easy to read and understand the code is clear and simple. If you think you are ready for JSP and are looking for a book to teach you the basics this is the book.It also comes with a CD that has a copy of Jrun and a database to install on your PC and give it all a try. This is a huge help.
2,"I am a guy who does not get excited about clothes or fashion accessories, but these sunglasses are the bomb! They are very comfortible and keeps out the Palm Springs sun. The best part of the glasses, chicks dig them! I got tons of compliments from girls since I got them. Yesterday, I wore them while playing tennis. The glasses filtered out the sun and glare making a lot easier to see the ball. The sunglasses are light, comfortable, and stayed firmly in place while running, bending over while playing tennis. I absolutely love these sunglasses."
2,"bought one, filled it, bought another... the remote takes some getting use to but now that I know where the buttons are that I need, it's fine... The disk explorer is useless. I use a spreadsheet, and just put them in by the number."
2,This thing is just as advertised. The hose is good quality. It is well built and works very well.One word of warning: This thing is HEAVY. Think through what you are going to mount it to and how.
1,"Set and costume design was top notch; however, this whole play was quite a hyperbole of a performance - too dramatic, too exaggerated, distasteful."
2,"Hi, I'm a big Nirvana/Kurt Cobain/Hole/Courtney Love/Drew Barrymore fan. This book was great. If you liked this book, I recommend Courtney Love:The Real Story by Poppy Z. Brite or Kurt Cobain and Coutney Love: In Their Own Words by Nick Wise."
1,"This book never arrived and has of yet still hasn't arrived, which does not speak well of the service provided by the seller (was it Amazon...I think so) and I will be looking into where it might be or what happened to it. thanks for asking me to review as I had forgotten that we purchased this...maybe we'll get it now!Maek me down as a less than please customer."
2,"I have thinning hair and a bald spot developing at the top of my scalp (male pattern baldness). This shampoo and conditioner (when used per the instructions, READ THE INSTRUCTIONS) seems to make my hair thicker. It has a medicinal smell, and my scalp really tingles after using the conditioner."
2,"This book is a great discipline. It has daily reminders that are extremely helpful. If you are looking for a good devotional program that will give you great direction, this is a good place to begin."
1,"this rambling book provides no secrets or trading tips to help the average trader. rather it is a history of the authors efforts to level the trading field between the market makers and DAET traders. While he is to be commended for these efforts, by using this title to the book, and the paragraphs within, he is in fact just as guilty of misrepresentation as the market makers he rails against"
1,"This DVD is awful. The audio is out of sync with the video and sometimes starts over midway through a pose. For one pose, the audio was for a completely different pose. I have another DVD that turns out to be the same set of routines, but on that one everything works.We will not use this DVD again and I will write to BodyWisdom to complain. From now on I will probably stick with Gaiam videos as every single one of those has been of high quality."
2,The replacement rings worked perfectly and we were back blending in not time. Thanks for the fast shipment. The replacement ring fit perfectly and kept it from leaking around the seal.
2,"I bought this sink because i wanted something sturdy and easy to clean and durable, non chippable. Well for the most part it fulfills that promise, the only thing that I've noticed is that it kind of lets the dirt cling to it. It's as if the surface weren't totally smooth. However, it is really beautiful and I am clutsy and it is forigiving, so we are a match. And it is easy to clean, just wish I didn't have to do it as often."
1,"I bought this vacuum b/c of the size and weight. We have hardwood floors and a BIG dog, so the need to vacuum is a daily occurance. Initially I liked this vac, because it was light and fairly easy to use.A few minor details-the cord is too short, and the filter gets full quickly, requiring you to remove it and bang it against the side of the trashcan to get the gunk out of the folds. This usually causes a pretty big dust cloud.These things are a little annoying, but not ""deal busters"". The MAJOR design flaw is that the exhaust comes out the front of the vacuum, right above the head. This results in any dust bunnies, dog hair or other lightweight stuff becoming airborn in a cloud ahead of you, and the larger stuff, acting like tumbleweed and rolling ahead of you.You can really tell on a sunny day with the sun coming through the window. Basically you end up stirring up and breathing all that stuff in. Yuck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Bottom line-great idea, poor execution!"
2,One of the best documentaries on wildlife I have ever seen! A must buy if it were available.
1,"My boss bought this camera for our communications department at work, and it's the fourth Kodak camera I've had experience with - and my least favorite so far.My biggest complaint is that this camera has VERY poor color. I have to edit everything in order to use it for our newsletters. All the pictures turn out very dark and grayish - partially due to the poor flash. If you were to buy this camera in hopes of capturing precious memories of your children, I think you would be disappointed. Outside photos would probably be fine - but inside photos have been very poor.The limited zoom is also a hindrance."
2,"I have watched several versions of Dracula but reading this book is the first time for me. Well, it has no close similarities with any movies I've seen except, of course, Bram Stoker's Count Dracula which has Hollywood spices in it. Compared to the movie, I felt the book's sense of the sensualities and Dracula's motivation in choosing his targets were less fluid and sometimes too coincidental. But I enjoyed the original hunting process more than the movie one, with treasured views from each man involved, not just Van Helsing's. My edition has the afterword which really helped to understand how the writing came to be like that but aside from all values it tried to represent, this is a referenced literature work everybody must not missed."
2,"this makes any bed more comfortable. get it, you wont regret it. i currently use my twinxl 3"" size on top of a cheapo mattress on floor. makes my sleep life so much better."
2,"The guy who fills me of energy every day right before heading to work, has made an even better cd, more of my taste. I feel he has added a little new style (that i love): tracks 4, 5 and 11 bring an extra scent of a Herman Olivera, lead vocalist, when we listen to him right after the choir, at the end or the middle of the sentence. I love it, it's my inspiration. Eddie is simply the best, now that Tito Puente has gone, leaving him with no big competience."
2,The book arrived in perfect shape and in record time. I would highly recommend using this company and would do so in the future.
2,"ME is much more reliable and efficient. New features like active ""start"" menu bar which hides less used shortcuts gives you better and tidy looking menus. Very useful for people like me. But it slows down the system as usual..."
1,"I was very disappointed in The Passionate Troubadour, but maybe because I was looking for a biography rather than a novel. There is definitely more fiction than fact in this book. Francis of Assisi had such a rich, colorful life with so many incidents that have been recorded in history, and each of these could have been explored with insight and love. But it seems to me that Hays wanted to write a novel and so tried to come up with many new ideas, incidents, and suppositions. My concern is that people will read this and think that this is the true story about St. Francis. It is not, sadly. Rather, it is a fictional tale about a great saint."
1,"Unfortunately, this title is grossly misleading. The pamphlet, not book, is a report of a survey of books about Greek and Latin lyric poetry. It is not an anthology. The report may be of use to persons searching for anthologies of Greek and Latin poetry, but will disappoint anyone who wants a book containing that poetry."
2,"I workout frequently and enjoy Tae Bo, the Slim in 6 and Core Secrets series, but being pregnant made me concerned about what appropriate exercise is. Modifying existing workouts works for awhile but as your belly grows it is important not to stain yourself and you need to focus less on weight loss and more on what is best for baby. Fit Mama Prental dvd is a lot of fun. The 20 min Salsa Dance workout is not only fun but it gets you heart rate up and can make you sweat if you really get into it. The Yoga Fat Burn is great and the modified mat work for pregnancy is incredibly helpful since traditional flat-backed mat work is out of the question past 15-20 weeks pregnant. I think the Salsa segment would be a blast even if I weren't pregnant. I highly recommend this.....all you need to do is add in some weights and some walking and you've got a great prengnacy routine to take you from week 1 to week 40. Best of luck to the mommie's to be!"
2,"I've been using Le Creuset for years, and am lucky enough to live near one of their factory outlets or else I might not be able to feed my addiction to their cookware, but this roaster from DBK seems to be as well made as Le Creuset but at about half the price I would pay at their stores. I've used it several times now and don't find it lacking in any way. Excellent pot at a great price."
1,"this was the cheapest VHS I've ever ordered. First..it took MONTHS to come and then it was as if EACH story was spliced unto a blank tape. EACH story had the ENDING credits and then it started the next story. It was ONLY 30 minutes long. I saw this SAME tape at [a store] and it was 60 MINUTES long. Bad, bad taping...could have done it myself"
1,"Seward should be ashamed of herself for this enormously biased gossip rag. It's quite easy to trash the Princess now... after all, the dead have a much more difficult time defending themselves."
1,"The publishers have found a unique way to make money - they take something that was produced by the government, slap a price on it and ship it out. If I had done more careful research, I would have realized that this product was available on the web at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory web site. In fact, an updated version is available for download.The work itself provides a general overview of various technologies, along with the developments and projections as to how that technology might be deployed in the future. It may be influenced by the priorities of the administration in power - this version gives a lot of play to the ""hydrogen economy"" that the administration is pushing."
1,"Let me be perfectly clear: This is not a bad book on how to successfuly play holdem. I would have no problem recommending this book to anyone who is interested in LEARNING how to play.However, as a book that advertises itself as how to play and win online it is no better than anything else out there. Which is to say: it is a disappointment. 80% of the book is dedicated to the basics of holdem play and strategy. The remaining 20% offers sometimes useful insight into playing online but nothing that is particularly insightful or revolutionary.[...]Finally, don't buy this book in search of the ""secret"" to winning on the internet. It is simply not any better or different than anything else out there. It's a good BASIC book on holdem, nothing more, nothing less. [...]"
1,"The quality of the used item I received is terrible! Not at all the equality I was expecting for the price. The used TI-83 graphing calculator is missing the battery cover, has no instruction pamphlet, and is filthy dirty. All of the keys stick and I don't even want to touch it. The seller should be ashamed of themself. This is not the quality I would expect from Amazon.com."
1,"I purchased this product with such high hopes. I read the reviews and looked forward to great results. As with some things though, the expectation fell so far from reality. I had adopted a Paleo lifestyle for the previous 3 months before starting to use this product and I was feeling great but thought, a good colon cleanse would be a good thing, right? Well, I should have left well enough alone. Within a week of using this product I was so bound up and gained 2 lbs. I was in so much pain that I was unable to continue using it. Within 3 days after discontinuing use, my system started getting back to normal and I felt so much better. I wanted to return the unused portion, I bought enough for 60 days, but apparently I threw away the packing slip and that is needed for a refund. So much money spent that is completely wasted. I'm happy for those that this product did work for but apparently, it wasn't for me."
1,"Bought this hoping that it would hold up to making small cookies for the kids. The size is great, but it keeps falling apart the part at the bottom so end up having to use a spoon."
1,"Sorry, but I wish that I would have saved my money on this one. Maybe because I'm a Jay Hickman fan is the reason that this one let me down. This one isn't as raw with the language as in some of the other comedy albums but I just didn't enjoy it."
2,"adequate size and very practical product for a short walk or a tour of the city, good material and durable, useful for carrying travel documents"
2,A great book to read as you watch our world bloom again. You will believe life is renewing and has pleasures to be found in the strangest places. Characters that are believable and who you would like to befriend. I recommend this to men and women.
2,"This tribute album is by far one of my favorites. I have listened to it numerous times since buying it and have advised my friends to BUY THIS CD. The instruments, vocals and mixing is truly flawless. If you like great music, you'll love this CD. ""Ride with Bob"" is indicative of where music is going...it is going back to it's roots!"
2,"This put the kart racing genre on the map. A fun game with many secret bonus characters, I you have ever played Magical Racing tour, this game is easier. In some parts, like getting the coins and letters C,T and R it is harder though. If you want to find a shortcut to this game, and any other game, go to gamesages.com This is a very fun game!!"
2,I love rebelde you should her it is a spanish cd I love a lot!!!! I love RBD I love them I love Diego The boys are all Hoties!!!!!!!!!!! They sing so good!!!!!11
2,"This work is as complete a technical work on the Flower Class corvette as one is likely to find.In keeping with this series of books it provides the reader with a technical description, photographs and scale line drawings on every conceivable aspect of this class. This work also provides a valuable look at the developments of this class of warship including refits, Modified Flowers and the Castle Class Frigate giving the reader a very complete history of development of a type of warship that has been overshadowed in most historical works by other vessels.Like most of the books of this series, I can not recommend this work highly enough."
2,"Honestly I only got the record for The Love Below, but I'll take it! I've been listening to this album for years and I'm so excited to finally have it in glorious vinyl! Came fresh outta package new so it's great, just a bit on the dusty side (I suppose it's from the factory, shavings and all!) But for 4 vinyls I can't complain! I love it now like I loved it then so it's a best buy imho! Recommended!"
1,"There is some serious slogging here. You can start right into the conversational, but each chapter is *so* dense that you don't feel like you are touching bottom! The beginners hindi version of this book is a *much* better version..."
2,"This is a terrific item. I read the reviews and bought one and liked it so much, I bought another one. The sound is perfect. No extra bass like boom-boxes, and every little sound comes through as if directly from the studio. It's amazing. Of course, it doesn't sound like huge speakers and a million dollar system. This is a tiny item. But you won't believe the clarity of sound it produces, even if you turn it up quite loud. It's certainly worth double the price I paid."
1,"I was excited to see that this booster could easily be cleaned in the dishwasher, but my 34lb son keeps falling out. The seat bottom detaches while he is sitting in it. It is horrible. It may be easier to clean, but I will go back to my other seat that has worked well for us for the last year and a half(Reclining 4-Stage seat by The First Years)."
2,"My son isn't old enough to read these just yet, but we all read them together for bedtime and they're clever and far more interesting than most bed time books we read."
2,"The Nikon D50 is everything it's touted to be. The picture quality is great and it is the perfect mix of easy to use, while maintaining manual/professional controls. The color balance and contrast only occasionally need adjusting. I have been particularly impressed with the nighttime portrait mode, which leaves a lot of the original ambiance of the picture and doesn't overwhelm your subject with a too bright flash. The lens that is included leaves something to be desired, however, and will likely need to be replaced with a faster one fairly soon. Overall, I am very please with this camera and the pictures it has produced thus far."
2,"Gods and Generals by Jeff Shaara is an exciting adventure of the Confederate and Union armies during the Civil War. Each chapter moves a to new General for either side. This wonderful, informal novel shows mainly the defense and attacking strategies of both armies. General Robert E. Lee of the Confederate Army is the main character that it talks about and whose scenarios are mentioned the most in this historic novel. He takes the Confederate Army from poor to excellent enough to defeat the Union on numerous occasions. This book is one of the best books I have ever read and I say that whoever is into the action involved with the Civil War and crucial moments and decisions should read this book."
1,"In their classic ""Playdough,"" The Aquabats pay tribute to Devo. The Devo influence becomes very obvious on their 3rd CD, which is also their weakest effort. Most of their trademark ska is missing from this album, replaced by a very Devo-esque new wave pop feel. It can be fun, but it just doesn't compare to the early stuff. In fact, some of the songs will have you reaching for the ""skip"" button, a first for an Aquabats CD. The songs are still wacky and have that Aquabats humor to them, but they're also slower and less melodic and fun. Luckily, for every weak song on the album, there's a good one to balance it out. Some of the best include the irresistibly fun ""Man With Glooey Hands"" and ""Lovers Of Loving Love,"" which might just be the greatest love song ever written. Unfortunately, those songs will be among the only ones played on this album. The rest may simply be skipped and forgotten. Still a great band though."
2,"The only downside to this game is that you have to constantly take your eyes off the screen to press keyboard buttons. A two button mouse would probably eliminate much of this problem. Otherwise, one of the best games I've played!"
2,"Detective Bryan Hurd finally finds his true love in Elmore Leonard's SPLIT IMAGES. He's a hard-working homicide detective on a vacation from all the various ways people can kill each other in Detroit City. And, believe or not, he falls in love at first sight with the beautiful and talented writer, Angela Nolan. Problem is, the detective can't escape his Detroit roots even while he's in Florida.We can almost see a tragedy coming his way as he hunts down the two Detroit killers, one a dashing movie star type, the other a jaded, disillusioned cop from the Polish neighborhood of Hamtramck, smack dab in the middle of rust-belt Detroit. These boys play rough and murder has become their game.These characters are all strongly back-storied, so we feel we know them well. And when the murders occur, we wouldn't blame Detective Hurd at all for taking his full revenge.by Larry Rochelle, author of the Kansas City thrillers: BLUE ICE, CRACKED CRYSTALS and DEATH AND DEVOTION."
1,"If you like any music with bass, these will not work. If you like to listen to music a little bit louder sometimes, these will not work. There is a lot of crackling if you do either. They're great for light listening while doing housework or sitting outside. I returned these because they won't work for what I was trying to do."
2,"I bought this filter for my kit 18-55 so that I could prevent the strange flare that occurs when I photograph my kids late-afternoon. I can't compare it to other filters, but it has definitely had a great impact on the overall quality of my photos."
2,"You wouldn't guess at the power of this book from it's size. As finely written as the complicated, intricately tatted lace fancywork Laverne's mother tatted into bleached sugar sacks, ""still whole after fifty years."" Stories as gripping and gritty as anything Hemingway ever wrote, featuring hailstorms that break every window in the house, treacherous horses, dogs, and rattlesnakes, and scandalous cowboys. Frequent flashes of wise, deep humor, understated and droll, that catches you unawares and leaves you laughing out loud. This was a woman worthy of the name. Would make a terrific movie."
1,"Index Mutual Funds worked in the high growth era of the 1990's, but have been bad news since. Therefore, the theory that an investor wastes his time by choosing a manager-run mutual fund is no longer valid, and probably never was. The 2000's have allowed truly great stock pickers to emerge and be in the spotlight. They are easier to find now and the phonies of the 1990's are fleeing the scene."
2,"(...) At first I was concerned about the plastic material and that some reviewers said that additonal attachments would not fit. Well the ""plastic"" is a special durable type and the ""other attachments"" now come with 2 adapters to fit all Dyson models. It really is easy to use and picks up embarrassing amounts of dirt! This model is cost effective over the plain DC15 since it includes the carpet kit, low floor tool, and mini turbine specifically made for this model. I think it will last a long time and is a very good value."
2,"I secretly rate this in my top twenty movies. I'm too old too fall in love with the Dawson's Creek boy, so no, I don't like it because of him. Sure, it's a bit of your typical sports movie, but it's a bit off edge as well. It's funny as hell. The characters are completely amusing and the southern hick accents top the charts. I may live in Nebraska, but I am not a football fan at all, yet this football movie is great for any movie fan.Believe me, you'll smile a lot, laugh a ton and sometimes wonder just what is going on. Enough, I better get off before someone I know sees me writing this good review about a movie most critics didn't like."
2,"These tapes are wonderful because the information is based on the antiquities, and the tour taken is much more meaningful. The traveler can go at his or her own pace. Reading a travel guide and then applying that knowledge later looses something, these tapes are as the title states ""Walk with Me"". The traveler feels just like he or she is walking with the author, a very knowledgable, real person who knows what travelers need!"
1,"Don't get me wrong. Clay can really sing. His voice is good enough, but his music is just so corny and boring. All ballads and wanna be broadway sounding songs. I can't even bear to listen. I only do it to figure out what all the furor is about. I still haven't. Save yourself the effort."
1,Amazing how bad so many old Hollywood veterans can be when they have a rotten script and lame directing. Everyone involved in this mess should feel ashamed. One of the worst movies ever. Any wonder used copies sell for one penny?
1,"Normally, I have been a huge proponent of Lego products, including their Software. Lego Loco, Lego Racers, Lego Stunt Rally, and Lego Alpha Team are all superb products. Lego Island 2 is slow to load, finiky in dealing with hardware and device drivers, and does not always make the controls obvious to the user. For something aimed at children and parents without time to debug and installation, this is not a good choice. I feel Lego should be more careful about licensing their name, as this is not up to their usually very high standards."
1,Painfully academic in it's delivery and the staged negotiation scenarios are stilted and slow.Book is a good read and offers some good approaches and negotiating techniques. The audio CD is dull and is an uninspired presentation of good material.
1,"This space heater worked quite well for about 3 months. Then it stopped working so well. It now works intermittently, but there is no clear indication when it's going to work and when it's not. I always have it in the same plug, the same floor, never tilted, and never in all night. But it only works intermittently, and even when it works, it sometimes clicks off for now reason. The red light is always on, so I know it draws enough power.Just note that I'm not the first person to write a review that says this, and I made the mistake of ignoring the others. Don't. Just buy a different space heater."
2,"This game is one of the best for the Neo Pocket. If you like Sonic or platform games at all you have got to get this one. Like the Game Gear version for graphix but with tons more ways to play, a link up option, and tons more to it. This game has the longetivity factor in bucket loads. Complete all the courses with more rings to get puzzle pieces which give secrets, try to get the best times for each level, and if your lucky you can bully a mate into getting the game to play the great link up modes (I haven't tried these but from what I hear they are worth waiting for, luckily my girlfriend is getting her copy soon)."
1,"This was the third shemagh I have purchased, and the only one I ended up throwing away. It was poor quality material before I washed it, but after washing it, it shrunk down so much that it was no longer square and the shape was distorted. It was also too small to use due to the extreme shrinkage. My other two shemaghs never had this problem."
2,"I won't make any health claims, but I will say it has helped me and the family get rid of colds much more quickly. do some research online. this is the TOP product in this category from the actual manufacturer. they have actually done studies and well as contracts with the military."
1,"The premise of the story is interesting in the same way maybe Jurassic Park makes you wonder - ""It would be neat if it could be true."" But the main character in this book is so slow to catch on. He has this arsenal of people who are excellent at their jobs of finding information for him and yet, he doesnt seem to know what to do with what he uncovers. As the reader, I found myself getting progressively irritated at Joe Lassiter. He was always at a loss. He was single minded about finding the Grimaldi character and dismissing an important connection to his riddle.If this was the authors style of 'suspense' - it left me irritated.Next time, find a smarter hero."
2,"Recentlly Germany ""Spieiegel"" released ColoredGerman lifes in Pre-War and during WW11.We can see the Clasic Govrnment Propaganda oriented manysimilar Official Celebrities with German Military Marches.But it also give us fresh,new pre-war german folks beautifultimes including their leisures by amateure Photographers.They mainly aimed pictures of Early Victorious Operation""Barbarosa"" with segmental Western Front.my raising one question is why these filims are released thistimes?.I also point out the who is leading this films includingNarrations. Occasioally ,I could hear beautiful music theirFolk's musics !"
1,"I watched it and really don't see where it is going. I didn't feel any connection with the characters at all.There needed to be a bigger buildup or something and it just seemed to kind of throw you into a disjointed storyline.I will watch a few more episodes, but the first one isn't giving me much hope."
2,I love these! They add color and sophistication to my kitchen. They have great color and luster. I highly recommend them.
1,"I saw the film and in the end I felt kind of disappointed. I am no sure what kind of message the film wanted to bring to us. It just did not impress me. I also can't understand how the moviemaker tried to, hatefully, demolish the Canadian Health Care System without proposing anything in its place. Very destructive. I bet the US health corporations will love the film since for years they have been trying to demoralize the Canadian Health Care in frequent and expensive TV adds. I even wonder if they have something to do with the film..."
2,"I found Heiland to be a unique perspective in the genre of anti-establishment fiction. I did not find its characters' being anglo and for grass roots Christianity as some kind of racist, anti-semitic statement. The author created an interesting piece by combining the rebel vs. tyrannical government theme with a utopia-that-could-be sci-fi theme. As contemplative fiction I find this book to be thought provoking and highly entertaining."
2,What a wonderful book. A wonderful body of knowledge and wisdom for the uncompromising eyes may seems to be right for its time but is truly a treaty for all the times. Each essay contains the cost of a life time. Full of interesting stories and a big deal of searching lights.
1,"This print arrived today; as soon as I unrolled it I realized I had made a mistake with this purchase. The quality is worse than if I had printed it on ""fast draft"" on my inkjet printer. The colors are incredibly under saturated, the contrast is extremely low, and the details are blurry.The original work is dark, and bright, with every shade of red and gold and grey. This is predominantly beige and brownish-orange. I never expected them to be able to replicate the actual metallic paint in the ""5"" in the center, but the colors of this whole print are way off.Furthermore, the entire painting is not on this print- about an inch all the way around is missing- in the original painting, on the right hand side, the window says ""...ART CO."" however this print has the ""CO."" cut off.This print is going in the trash."
1,"The Black & Decker CTO6301 is feature rich. It looks nice. My wife who is blind could operate it. Pretty impressive. EXCEPT IT IS TOO HOT ON THE OUTSIDE!. As other reviewers have said it takes a long time to toast, I guess because it is so large. It is actualy scary to operate, even for a few minutes. I think there is more heat on the outside than the inside. I cannot imagine what baking would be like in it.Anyway we are sending it back. We need to find one with better insulation and no doubt a little smaller so it is a practical toaster. Nice try B&D; but no cigar."
2,"I wanted Carrie to win right from the beginning. For the first time ever in an idol competition, I was right! I definetly think that Carrie will sell more albums than Kelly, Ruben, Fantasia, Clay, or whoever. I think that she will evolve to be one of the best singers of 2005."
1,"I have read a lot of True Crime books but never have I read one as poorly written and dumb as this one. This guy is trying to make a killing out of the fact that he committed crimes and then went to jail for them and that makes him a hero? Who is he joking? He's a lousy criminal, he got caught, he went to jail, end of story. I have heard from people far more connected to Whitey Bulger than this low level drug dealer that he was anything but the tough guy in Bulger's mob that he tries to create in this ridiculous book. All he is trying to do is prove he is still a man. After wasting my money on this silly book, I still remain unconvinced. Don't even think of buying this pathetic book."
1,"I didn't read this book. But I find the title sick. If you find yourself wondering about such things, think about what makes you happy. Wealth, unless you're more animal than most humans, does not bring happiness. Re-eveluate your values. Thank you."
2,"I bought this book because I remembered liking it in school. I have been reading it to my son at night, and he really seems to enjoy it."
1,"""Witchhouse"" is an artificial low-budget supposedly horror-comedy hybrid (plenty of unintentional comedy but zero horror) which is truly lame and totally ridiculous. In the mold of ""Night Of The Demons"", ""Witchhouse"" is about a strange girl, Elizabeth, who decides to have a party with some of her carefully selected friends at an old house named Witchhouse. Elizabeth's ancestors were Satanists and she uses a little witchcraft to conjure up one of her beloved relatives. Plagued by bad make-up, pathetic special effects, horrible acting, a poorly executed plot, and a lifeless and pathetic script, I can say without reservation that ""Withchouse"" is a total zero and a complete utter joke. Maybe a good one for the brain-dead juvenile delinquent in your home, but that's about it."
1,This is one of my favorite western shows and I have been waiting for this second season release.I give this show 5 stars but what is up with the price being doubled over season 1?For the rediculous price; I give this one star. Let's get real.
1,"The ageing 60's left sounds a little strident...and pathetic. While the best-seller lists are dominated by conservative mainstream publications - such as ""Bias"", revealing what we always knew - the worn-out left is still [pandering] to Marxism, enviro-nazism, and any form of anti-heterosexualism that the current fad embraces. If you like to laugh at the same old ""blame {big-business, Christian, free-market, heterosexual, working-for-a-living, intelligent choice, monogamous, wise-use} individuals who are responsible for all of us loser's problems"" - type articles, this is the magazine for you! I'll stick with the land of opportunity, hard work, and wise choices to get me through!"
1,"I bought two of these in September 2001, thinking to network multiple PCs and share a broadband connection. Installation was a pain, requiring me to pin an IRQ in the BIOS for a Windows Me machine. The board ran-- for one day-- and then died. I got the other one working intermittently until I upgraded to Windows XP. Under XP, for one glorius month, everything worked great. In January, my machine locked up and the board stopped working.I tried everything, including doing a complete reinstall of Windows 95 on a spare machine, to determine if it was XP. It wasn't. Neither board worked on a simple Windows 95 setup. I have a computer background and I even tried debugging the device driver initialization before determining that the boards were fried.Buy another vendor's product."
1,I got it to work after much struggle the first time I took it out. After that it wouldn't work at all. Nothing happens when I change the lever from the up to down position and it leaks air when I try to use it. I'm late to class today due to a flat tire CAUSED by this pump. DO NOT BUY!
2,Great DVD. Worth getting.I can't believe Angelina Jolie does her own stunts. Looking at the extra features is a real eye-opener - what do they save for the stunt crew? The semi-lethal stuff?
1,The rack did not fit any of my neoprene dumbbells. Did not find this out until it was all assembled. Bummer. Not sure what the rack is for??Amazon was very good about authorizing a UPS pickup for a free return and a credit to my account.
1,"I would rate it zero star if it's possible, it sure is a rip-off. The studios very well know that the consumer is willing to pay for the Blu-Ray version then why are they not doing it for the extended release unless they are planning to add another atleast say 10 minutes of movie to all the three individually and then also the theatrical version release is just bogus."
1,The top piece fit decent - but the bottom piece was way too big - what good does it do to have it only cover one part? The top does show quite a bit of smudging - and it was scratched within a week. I thought it would hold up much better for the price paid.
2,"I purchased the FURminator deShedding Tool to use on my two cats. One has short hair, the other long hair. I mainly bought this for the long haired cat because her fur gets tangled and matted. The FURminator works so well, it pulls up a lot of the loose fur. The cats don't like it, but they tolerate it (but they also do not like regular cat brushes either). Yes, you do get fur ALL over you and the floor, but honestly it's worth it. Just change your clothes and vacuum up the cat fur off the floor.This is more expensive than a tradition cat brush but it works so much better. Definitely worth the investment!"
1,I have purchased the 100 pack Sony DVD-Rs and CD-Rs cheap from Costco and most fail to burn properly on my PC. A waste of money. I won't buy them again.The TDK and Memorex brands work fine. Maybe there will be one bad disc in a 100 for those brands.
1,"Seems like a decent enough product, but on the very first use, one of the brushes fell off of the bottom of the lens cleaner while inside my car CD player, so now I've got a lens cleaner with one brush instead of two, and a fuzzy little brush part somewhere in the innards of my CD player. So far it hasn't done any harm, but the quality control appears to be lax."
1,"I was expecting to buy a DVD on the different parks at Disney and get a sense of what Disney is all about. I got this DVD for my mother-in-law to give her as prelude of what's to come as I got her tickets to Disney for Christmas. I wanted her to see how much fun Disney can be. What the different parks offer. The parades. The firework display at the end of the night. All of that. Unfortunately, even though this DVD was nicely done and informative, it was all about rollercoasters and nothing but rollercoasters. My 70 year old mother-in-law doesn't want to ride a rollercoaster. This DVD doesn't even state that it's a DVD on rollercoasters. That's why I'm giving it such a bad review. If the title had been WALT DISNEY WORLD ROLLERCOASTERS, then yes, it would have gotten five stars. But since this DVD did not specify that it was solely about rollercoasters, it misleads you into buying something you do not have any interest in. That's why it's only getting one star."
2,"This is wonderful, it moves around the can on it's own and leaves the top and rim without a sharp edge. Because of this it does leave the can more flexible."
2,"I have been waiting for this album to come out on CD in Mono. I absolutely detest the Stereo version of ""California Dreamin'"". And now, this album is in my hands and I love it. Beautiful sound quality. Rich tones and Beach Boy-Like harmonies. Superb! Alert: There is some analog hiss at the beginning of most of these songs. I can hear it with headphones but not on my stereo system. The original mono master tapes were supposedly lost and I'm sure that these songs were taken from a very clean record. But the vocals are so much better in Mono that, to me, it's not a problem. That's how it sounded on the album when I bought it in 1966. And it's great!"
1,Eh ben franchement cet album mis a part 3 ou 4 chansons granx max n'est pas terrible que ca!! les musique font vraiement pitié encore une chance que 50 cent est là pour limiter les dégats en étant pratiquement sur toutes les chanson moi voilà cet album est plus un grand coup de marketing genre 50 fait de la pub pour ces anciens copains (qui le sont tjs) pour lancer un album trop incipide!! Ecoutez le bien en magasin avant de l'acheter!!
2,"This is a terrific Bible. NASB is a conservative, literal, trustworthy translation. Thompson's is a wonderous system for tying together spiritual truths. The page layout is superb, lots of room for notes. The study helps are tremendously comprehensive; you could spend a lifetime exploring them. The presentation is elegant. It would hve been nice if the the spine were ""hubbed"", but that's a trivial critique. This is a fantastic edition of the Bible. Unless you're the type who's never satisfied with anything, you will not be disappointed with this one."
1,"Stargazer, recorded in 1997, features the same band employed in Douglas's Booker Little tribute recording, In Our Lifetime (Douglas on trumpet, Chris Speed on tenor sax and clarinet, Joshua Roseman on trombone, Uri Caine on piano, James Genus on bass, and Joey Baron on drums), this time around playing ""music by and for Wayne Shorter."" As with the earlier recording, but even more so this time, I found Stargazer to be quite tedious. Oncer again, there were some interesting moments, but the most part, the performances were overly earnest and overly busy. Drummer Baron especially overplays his part this time around, just overdoing it and not letting the music breathe. I think I could maybe have enjoyed this CD had a different, more subtle drummer been employed and I have heard Baron do much better on many other recordings -- not sure what the problem was on this outing), but in the end, this recording simply wore out my patience."
1,Toy has been out of the box for 1 hour.....Leg broke offTail has unscrewed from the monkeyGood idea poor execution!
2,"There isn't much more I can say about this book that hasn't already been said but I will try anyway. I read this quite a few years ago on a friend's recommendation. And OH MY GOODNESS! My words do not do this book justice!! Sedaris' take on life and his way of telling stories is unlike anything I have ever read or heard. This book was so laugh-out-loud funny that at any given moment while reading this book I could be found spitting coffee out of my mouth, bending over in laughter and yes maybe even wetting my pants!! (okay, so the last one never happened but this book is just that funny!!)"
2,I bought this model after using the canon powershot A95. I was satisfied to find that the quality of Canon remained the same irrespective of the size of the camera. All the features that come with Canon were there and the ease of using the camera did not go down by even 1 iota. All in all I am a Canon customer for life.
1,I am very hard to please because I like both clitoral stimulation and vaginal penitration! This item does not work for what I intended it for! I tried it twice and hated it both times I was so worked up from trying to make it work that I had to switch back to my bullet! I gave it to my best friend after swabing it down with rubing alcohol! She loves it she says it does the trick but it is deff not for me!
1,"With this toy, your child is more likely to get ADD than a PhD. (ADD = attention deficit disorder)I see Vegas, not Harvard, as the more likely future for children who play with this obnoxious toy.The toy is bosy and shallow.Sure, it has lights and noise, but only at times with purpose.It's the educational equivalent of cotton candy.Any toy that has to repetitively tell you how fun it is to play with probably isn't. (""Hit the drum, it's FUN!"")I had high hopes for this toy based on the other reviews. Unfortunately, I dislike it so much (my daughter isn't interested in it, either - even the box it came in was more interesting) I'm going through the hassle of sending it back.Spend your money on something else."
2,"This Game brings hunting on the computer to a new level. I am amazed by the amount of different looking deer and all the new graphics. I have DH3 and I thought that was great! Now Wizard Works hit the mark again with DH5. I will buy new versions as they come out. If you are a hunter, or just like to shoot mass quanities of deer, then this game is for you. Thanks Wizard Works! Kepp it coming."
1,"I was excited that Mad Men was back, until I watched the first episode. If the entire series was this wooden and boring, it would have been cancelled after the pilot. Episode one was poorly written, badly directed, and the actors seemed to be just going through the motions. If the rest of the season is this bad, you may want to think twice before plunking down your money. Talk about not living up to the hype!"
1,"This product description is deceiving, does not do as described. sent a e mail to the company and they DID NOT RESPOND"
2,"This movie reminds viewers that war is a terribly frightning thing. The Speilbergian touch (Upham) is enough to make me want to re-edit the movie, though. It's loosly based on historical events, but each of the characters are so distincly written-in to the story that it watches more like PROPAGANDA than a homage to the fallen."
2,I love this cream and am also disapppinted at how hard it is to find. It absorbs well into my skin without being greasy.
1,"I bought two of these. One broke the first time I used it, the other lasted two weeks. Simply put, these controllers are cheap. They aren't as durable as standard Nintendo controllers. Buyer beware. If I had it to do over, I'd have bought some authentic N64 contollers."
1,"It's junk. I got the ""white screen of death"" just as some of the other users on TWO monitors bought at the same time within 3 days of each other. It happened suddenly just after the warranty ran out conveniently. Ya gotta wonder how so many people have had the same problem so soon after the warranty expires. Any disbelievers? Google it!! Don't waste your money!"
1,"They've completely butchered not only a classic Kansas song, but also my all-time favorite Radiohead song. If you can't write your own music, the least you could do is not recreate songs that don't need recreated to begin with. Some things are definitely better untouched.. or unsung in this case."
2,"These are a good movie , especially how they incorporate it into the tv series. i highly recommend it to anyone who is curious about the sci-fi adventure."
2,The cane arrived in pristine condition. It was fully assembled. All that was necessary was to open the box. This cane is adjustable. It is not necessary to stoop down to hold onto the cane.
1,"I literally could not get past the first line of this book without finding glaring errors.""Marijuana is the second most popular drug after alcohol in our country today."" (Baum, Page 1)Aside from being a hopelessly clumsy sentence, this statement ignores caffeine and tobacco, which are respectively, psychoactive and narcotic substances."
1,"We have NOT received this product, but you want a comment on it's greatness?? It is now three days after Christmas and my grandson is without. Still waiting..... I rated it because you forced me to :(("
2,"This is a wonderful book for toddlers and very young children. One of my first memories as a child is of my mother rocking me to sleep while reading this book to me. Now, I read it to my grand-nieces who love it as much as I did. The only downfall is the illustrations are only three color (orange, black and white)so it may be a little autstere for small children who like lots of bright colors."
2,"I remember first hearing this CD back in 1989 and it just blew me away! It kicks major Texas ass and I was so happy to meet the band at the Backroom in Austin, Texas. The songs in this CD just really rock so hard it will drive you wild. I love this album and I am sure you will love it too! Junkyard still kicks major ass all the way!"
2,"I know this one didn't do very well in the charts, but this is a really great record. There is not one bad song in the bunch and the musicianship is fantastic. Put this album on after a long day at work, grab your drink, put your feet up, and enjoy."
2,Really enjoyed this book. Well written and great lists you can add to yourself. Didn't think it was over the top.. but encouraging the reader to have more forward thinking in planning for contingencies.
1,"The worst thing a dictionary can do is misspell a rather common word....Page 884 (Spanish) of the 2003 edition has ""venajo"" and it should be ""venaje"" Check Cassell's or Larousse Gran Usual....It is unfortunate that the ""old"" Velázquez is being handled so poorly by the new owners....Mary"
1,"I bought theChampion Power Equipment 46534 4,000 Watt 4-Cycle Gas Powered RV Ready Portable Generator With Wheel Kit (CARB Compliant)as a gift for my father. Told my brother to buy this cable to go with it since I noticed other people bought this cable who had also purchased this generator. The plug on this cable does not work with this generator. The cable's plug is only slightly off, but it's off enough that you will have to spend 22 dollars to buy the correct plug. Other than that the cable appeared to be heavy duty and of good quality."
2,"The wisdom of Richard Baxter's THE REFORMED PASTOR should be required readng for all who are even thinking about going into the ministry. It will make you re-think your calling, and look into your personal conviction to Christ like few other books can. A must read."
2,"I've been a Slayer fan for 17 years and have seen them 4 times (#5 in Feb.!!!)and this disc puts you in the feel of one of their live shows.This disc is well worth the money.I have two small complaints, though.#1 I wish there were more backstage interviews,etc.(none really).#2 During the middle of Postmortem Jeff Hanneman makes a mistake by goinginto a riff too early and he looks around as if he knew he did it.Not a big deal,but something I caught.If you have never listened to Slayer and want to jump on somewhere this is the disc for you."
1,"To be honest, this voice sounds like a voice major's junior recital--and by that I don't mean the voice sounds fresh. It's incredibly limited in range and almost always harsh on the top. Frankly I'd rather hear Schubert sung by just about anyone else. For these songs skip this one and try Elly Ameling. DeGaetani's pianos and pianissimos are nice but it is hard to understand how she had a career with the instrument she possessed."
1,13 months ago ago I bought a Sony clie tj-35The back light doesn't work and I am told it from their tech support website it is going to cost me $124.00 to fix it.I am going to buy a palm tungsten E. I feel I've been ripped off.
2,"To be perfectly honest, I really don't understand how this classic is rated below a 4-star by any reader. Yes I know that every reader has their own personal taste but this story is a classic for the ages. Every kid in a middle school should have to read this story about how lucky we are to be able to read books, no matter what the content or agenda the story might contain.Anyone who has never read this story should pick up a copy and start immediately. It's the best $.25 you will ever spend."
1,"The book from which the movie was made was the only non-fiction I've read in years. It is a wonderful and excellent book. If I had not read the book, the movie would have made no sense, and I'm not sure it did make sense even after reading the book.So much is missing that it would take ""Super Hero"" to put all the chops, cuts, splits, omissions, lack of continuity, no character development, the two plots totally lost....to make sense of it all.What an awful way to destroy one of the best books I've read in many years."
1,Record Rewind Pause Live Tv On Computer Capture Tv Video ImagesCouldn't get it to work. Had to return it. What more is there to say? Title tells it.
2,"I was very impressed by the quality of the recordings and the picture was so crystal clear that it was like he had been flimed yesturday....it has a great song list....BUT....I actually sent it back because the bonus 15 tracks that where supposed to be extra footage where actually not included..and allot of the song that where in the supposed bonus footage are teh songs that I like most....it was a real shame that they missed out the bonus footage as it would of made an excellent addition to your collection...also one thing that really annoyed me was that It came in one of those cheap card board covers, instead of the standard plastic sleve covers, which is really annoying as it easly gets wrecked and torn...in conclusion I would probably wait till they re-release it with the bonus footage!!"
2,"I was concerned that wireless would not work in my two story house and I wanted to save money. Therefore I had decided to run cables and had purchased the SMC SMC7004ABR Cable/DSL Router as a part of that plan. I was really surprised at the tiny size of the unit when the box arrived. I updated the firmware and had it running within minutes. I did plug-in one other system and it received an IP address w/o problems. I soon decided that wireless was the way to go after all and attached an SMC2655W Wireless Access Point to the router. So far, it's worked like a charm.One quirky issue to an otherwise flawless installation is that the printer driver program doesn't execute on my Windows 2000 system. After I click on setup.exe I see the hourglass for a moment, but that's it. This is not a big concern to me, but a little strange. I sent an email to the tech support group at SMC but have yet to hear anything. Any feedback on this issue would be appreciated."
2,"A great book, I really enjoyed it and I think any fan of Nicholas Sparks will like it as well. I acutually re-read it the other day when I had nothing to read! Thanks"
2,"A very handy educational tool for children in the primary school stage, ages 6-9. Especially useful with slow learners whose concepts need to be developed and cleared in novel and interesting ways every time. Also good for gifted children, to hone thier skills and increase their speed of processing language. The approach is designed to get kids interested and involved, wihtout making them feel like they're being made to work hard."
1,"I couldn't make it through this album. Imagine Interpol with even less of a clue and more overbearing artiness. Basically, I'm just writing this review so I can give it a 1 star, thus dropping it's overall score down where it belongs. Somewhere near -pi."
2,"Having read the first two, I think Storm of Swords was the best yet. I devoured this book in about 3 days, barely able to set it down. He has a style of writing so when you finish a chapter your left on the edge of your seat, excited to get back to that particular substory. The story itself bounces back and forth amongst 5 or 6 substories but you can see them all set for an exciting collision course. If you like Jordan but are tired of all the boredom, come here. Theres really not a boring chapter in this entire book. Great read"
2,"Within this edition their will be turmoil, their will drama, their will be justice, their will be sadness, their will be Evangelion. To review this edition is difficult since most most people either grasp the entirety of the turmoil and emotion involved, or they don't at all. All that can be said, or should be said, is that if you have watched the series this far, don't stop.It only gets better."
1,"I have to agree with the other poor reviews. We found the comic terribly illustrated, hard to read, and just not very entertaining. We ended up just reading the text written part in the back. Save it for the jeph loeb series."
1,"I've bought two LaCie's over the past two years. In both instances after about a year or so it will only show up on my desktop intermittently, then completely stop showing up. Data recovery from one of these things costs between $600 - $2500 (I spent $1000), not to mention the cost of replacing it with another drive. Do not buy this brand."
1,"I purchased this thermometer for homebrewing. The relationship started off well, but soon the bottom fell out and I find myself in the market for a better model. Taylor is touchy, fussy, inaccurate, and not always willing to show you what you want to see: the current accurate temperature. For the short time we were together and things were working out, it really was nice, but it faded so quickly."
2,"Gotta love the internet, I never purchased this item but love to review things. How is that any different than professional sports I will never know. Semper fi, never been in the military either......"
1,"I had read the other reviews and thought I had found the perfect solution for my microwave. I followed the directions, but to no avail, it sits there lifeless and doe snot spin. My food is still unevely heated and I am completely disappointed. You would be better off, heating your food for half the expected time, taking it out , mixing it and turning it yourself, then finishing heating, rather than purchasing this product."
2,"LOVE this saucepan. It was recommended in Cooks Illustrated and I also highly recommend it. Nothing sticks to it! The lid is glass, so you can observe whatever you're cooking. The handle is sturdy. I like the curved lip of the saucean itself for pouring sauces out with no problems or runs down the outside of the pot. It's the perfect size pot for everyday use."
1,"Apart from the somewhat ammusing story where Oliver Queen's son join for a night on the town (a story in which Winick does showcase his gift for non-action stories involving social interaction between two male characters), this whole thing is rather mindless with Winick ripping off both Kevin Smith (the dome over the city created by a demon-summoning rich man = the dome over the Drover Brownstone created by a demon-summoning rich man) and himself (the demons here = the monsters in Straight Shooter). Go reread Quiver instead."
2,"Sleeping Queens is a blast! I bought it for my daughter for Christmas and we were hooked on it from the start. I know it is geared towards kids, but even us adults have had fun playing the game. The colorful and cute cards are great to look at, but there is strategy involved in this game. In short, it offers something for everyone. I highly recommend this card game to anyone with young kids. But be warned- you may fall for the game yourself!"
1,"Al Franken is a smart guy and he is right that the Fox News is a biased right-wing organization. He is right about alot of things. But like Ann C. is to the right, he is too much a left winger. People like him and Ann, don't represent this country and neither offers any real solutions to make America better. All you get is name calling and finger pointing to the other side. While he makes some good points, he needs needs to show some common sense in his opinions. He has alot of good ideas, but no one will take him serious unless he moves to the center."
1,"I was looking for popular culture takes on the seven deadly sins and Dante's ""Inferno"".This book was a superficial glitzy product that appeared thrown together.It did not have much to offer as either pop culture entertainment or as an illustration of (the consequences of a lack of) morality."
2,LOVE NANCY DREW.THIS DVD HAS THE BEST OF NANCY DREW.VERY INTERESTING.I THINK I WAS LUCKY TO FIND.I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED NANCY DREW.
1,"This worked for about 10 minutes and then the power went off on all of the ""hot"" devices that were supposed to remain hot. Adjusted the sensitivity according to the directions and it still didn't work. Basically it's 1/2 of a generic power strip now. Very disappointing."
2,"I've been burnt by so many over-hyped, absolutely cr*ptacular fantasy books of late, I was sincerely afraid to dig into this (having bought it in a large order of other absolute crud like '5th Sorceress'). Immediately, I knew that this was going to be much higher in quality. A much more skilled narration develops the world and the characters, and sets forth a very ambitious and less-predictable plot. This was a fun read, and led me quickly to order the 2nd installment (equally good!)."
2,"I bought this back in September (2006) and was a little concerned about weight limits. One of the pictures I saw showed the hook holding a step ladder, but I have a Little Giant ladder (a combination extension and step ladder deal) which is quite handy, but also quite heavy relative to other step ladders. Bottom line, yes it can support the weight. I've had it up since October and it doesn't show any signs of excessive strain or warping. (I also have another one holding a double stroller)"
2,This coat rack was very easy to put together and looks great. It holds a lot of coats on any of the hangers without tipping over. It will tip if one of my small children tries to pull her coat off put that's pretty expected. Overall I would highly recommend it.
1,"What do you buy a blu ray musical performance for? Good video? yes, but you probably get it for the lossless audio track. The TrueHD track on this disc is very poor. It is more like 3.0 rather than 5.1. And the center channel is carrying at least 80-90% of the 3.0. The rear channels are non-existant. The stereo mix is brighter and has a better mix out of the front 3 channels. If you like Neil just get the DVD.The video is good and the concert is superb like all of his concerts are. It is just that the disc is bad. I have over sixty blu-ray and HD DVD concert discs. This audio mix is one of the worst, similar to some of the first to come out 4-5 years ago. Rating purely on the audio. I would have given it one but Neil is outstanding."
2,I like the convenience of only one charger that recharges many different battery sizes. The item works great.
1,"I purchased this product to fit my Penguin Bio Wheel 200. As the details say, it fits. However, it is not like the original part: the magnet is much shorter. As such, it does not move as much water. I now have to purchase the correct part from somewhere else.Two stars because the description is not wrong but no more than two stars because the description is misleading."
2,"You can't go wrong with these speakers, especially for this price! These are good both for listening to music and playing computer games. The sub-woofer is powerful enough and the sound range is good enough for a casual listener. There ports on the right speaker to connect a headphone and an auxiliary device (IPod) which is really useful. Mine came with an IPOD stand which i really love since it saves my ipod from scratches and stuff. The build quality is pretty decent. A very well made product for a decent price, highly recommended!"
1,"This album is getting good reviews here, and it's nice to see people still keen on Paradise Lost. Unfortunately, this album was ""lost"" on me. Their newest one, Symbol of Life, is an excellent album. It's dark and heavy and has incredible hooks. To me, Believe in Nothing sounded more like Nickelback. Yes, it's heavier than what they were doing for a while, but I find it pretty uneventful, and there's certainly nothing gothic about it."
1,"Okay - I've never been a fan of live recordings. Seeing a band perform live can be Earth-shattering, listening to a live recording is only noisy. I didn't do my research and didn't realize this was all live, or I would have never bought it. I love the clean precision of Yes studio recordings, I don't want to hear cheers and whistles in the background."
2,"It may start out boring but inside is the intense in-battle story against the British. This Revolutionary War story is about a young boy named Adam who sees his father and friends murdered on the battle line at Lexington. Together Adam, a crazy old X-British officer and some friends drive the British out (not alone, there was all of the other farmers too, they just stayed in a group). Un-like other revolutionary war storys this one takes place in a two day period with gruesome detials of war. Once you've read the book the movie is a cheap immation but fun none the less.<BR"
1,The case I received was too small for my htc TYTN. Contacting customer services wasn't helpful at all. I was questioned whether I know how to fit a cell phone case and whether I have a exteneded life battery (which isn't available on this phone).I told them that I almost have to tear the case apart to fit the phone in and don't want to do it again. But they insist that they need to a see a picture of how the case doesn't fit and I eventaully torn the plastic front cover right off the leather back portion of the case. So I send them the pictures of the torn case and After about four email exchange customer service went silent on me.Save your money. Don't buy this!!
2,"Nichelle Nichols, best know for her work on Star Trek, is charming on ""Out of This World"". Nichols, who once toured with Duke Ellington in the 1950's, jumps all over the musical map. Everything from pensive ballads, the wonderful and emotional ""Gene"", to all-out rockers, like the spellbinding ""Ancestry"". This song is a classic that should have found a home on alternative rock radio. Her delivery is almost punk-rock in it's unique phrasing. Very refreshing indeed! If you appreciate alternative music, you'll just love this album! I only wish she was still recording!"
1,wow...this is just so bad that I feel sorry for everyone involved. Inappropriate acting and embarrasing special effects. jeez...
2,"I just purchased 2 of these Aerobeds for my little girls to replace the cheap princess ones I purchased at Target (they didn't last 2 weeks). I was VERY impressed that this item received 5 stars with 541 reviews (as of August 2010). My 3 and 4 year old daughters slept on them for the first time last night...""camping"" in the living room. This is the first night in almost 3 months that my 4 year old didn't end up in my bed...so I'm gonna say it's a BIG hit in our house...she obviously slept comfortably. It was SUPER easy to inflate. It comes with a small pump and a storage bag. We look forward to many more nights ""camping"" in the living room. OH...and Amazon is one of the few online sites that has it for the GREAT low price. It's nearly $80 on most other sites. This family gives it 2 thumbs up. =)"
2,"I've noticed that Dane has taken lots of criticism here regarding his comedy. First of all i have to say that although Dane Cook does aim a lot of his comedy at a younger crowd, he is one of the most diverse and orginal comedians working today. From his language, to his gestures, to the content of his jokes, he is an amazingly funny, absolutely hilarious comedian that uses his charm and personality to captivate audiences. Dane Cook is not extremely successful simply because he is good looking but because when you listen to his comedy or watch one of his performances, it makes you feel good and feel better about your day. Being a fan of Dane and having his comedy to fall back on, has helped me through some difficult times because he has the ability to make you truly forget about your problems for awhile. to anyone who doubts Mr. Cook, let me just say I have never had a comedian make me laugh so hard!"
2,Wow! Christina Aguilera has done it again! Another successful music release. I like most of the songs on here and the translations of her famous chart toppers are great. At times she sounds very forced in speaking spanish. 4 stars for this one!
1,The movie was upposed to be funny. I couldn't even follow it. I ended up shutting it off halfway through.
2,"Hunger Games is enjoyable. I read all the books and was pleasantly surprised by the movie. I found it very entertaining and there was enough of subtle hints and clues dropped here and there for future movies to make them even more interesting. Definitely recommend. But the books are still better; nevertheless, I have never seen a movie that was better than the book. Enjoyable! :)"
2,"I love Laura Ingalls Wilder as an author. I think her books are interesting and well written. Her descriptions of events, places, people, and time periods cannot be beat and it draws you right in."
1,"The are a lot of warnings about this product making both cats & dogs sick or worse yet dying, check the internet for reviews & warnings. I bought this product but threw away. I read the warnings after purchasing."
2,"The Greatest book I ever read, and I will read it again. Maybe I missed something. Everyone! It's a must read."
1,"Frankly, I don't understand what all the fuss is about. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink is a perfectly good forward with a decent record for both Leeds and Chelsea, for whom at the time of writing he had scored 9 goals this season (including a hat-trick against Wolves last weekend).True, the Dutchman has been left out of Holland's provisional Euro 2004 squad, and may not have the most creative or well-executed goal celebrations in the league, but I don't think times are so hard that he's had to record an album, despite 'Hot Shot City' being a particularly good track."
2,"I had this exact item, but it had worn out and wouldn't stay wound. I was hoping to find a competetive item on the market that might work better, but was unable to. In the end, I had to agree with many of the reviews I was seeing that pointed out that it worked fine for the money. I realized that my old one had probably lasted over 10 years before it started wearing out, which is really pretty good based on the relatively small amount that I paid for it."
2,Water for ElephantsI really enjoy this book. It's written well to keep your interest. I read the book in one day because I wanted to know what happened next. Well done!
2,"Received these shoes with enough time to break them in before a weekend hike. I've been wearing them for the past couple of days and they are extremely comfortable with a short break in time. I had my reservations after reading some reviews stating that they ran small or had sizing issues, but I ordered the 12 wide (my normal shoe size) and they fit like a glove, with just enough room for hiking socks. Will report back once I finish the hike, but so far these are a great value."
1,"What was beginning in season four continues: the inability of the writers to keep the story innovative and exciting. This season made me cringe AGAIN when CTU was attacked AGAIN by terrorists. The new characters are shallow and are horrible actors (with the exception of Milo-though he is technically a season one character returning). The show has run its course and I think should be nearing its end. The writers have killed off every interesting character by this point except Chloe. Watch through season 3 for sure, after that view at your own risk.Here is the order in my humble opinion.Season 3 - best seasonSeason 1Season 2Season 5Season 4Season 6 - worst season"
2,"The Arcade Fire are a highly remarkable band, with a lot of magic surrounding their aura. I have enjoyed this band from their self-titled EP, and have continued to enjoy everything about their interesting sound. Neon Bible is nothing short of epic, and the band proves that their critically acclaimed ""Funeral"" was just the beginning.All of the songs have a very in-depth meaning, have it be about falling bombs, priests/churches, or self-depreciation. The gorgeous ""Intervention"" is splendid, with it's pipe organ and plush vocals. The band, with an astounding seven members, works together like a well-oiled machine. ""The Well & The Lighthouse, one of my favorites, is a song that is bound to be made historic.Arcade Fire is a historic artist, and is bound to captivate the shallowist of listeners with it's sublime music making. I recommend getting this album, and cherishing every last song on it, because this album is definitely the best of 2007."
1,"Legitimate indigenous spirituality is out there, but Huna is a farce. Max Freedom Long created it in 1930 after teaching in Hawai'i and making a study of the language after being ignored by all the shamans. This is re-packaged New Age philosophy. It gets two stars for the writing, but there's nothing here."
1,"This book was poorly written. It repeated itself numerous times. Dr. Morrison acts as though the world, including cops, are against her. They say psychologists enter the field due to their own personal issues, and this book shows that. She bashes the police, detectives, correctional officers, and FBI in nearly every chapter. If you interview as poorly as you wote this book, I wouldn't want you on my investigation either. Book is poor, don't waste your money. If you are looking for a well written book about serial killers, read ""Alone with the Devil."""
2,"I have a personal problem with this product.. Oh don't get me wrong, I love the taste of it. I picked it up at the checkout line yesterday. It is not the delicious taste I have a problem with.My biggest problem is that this product seemed to have set a trend to ""aerated chocolate"" I had a problem with it in the seventies when this British product came out. The concept is really old, dating back to the thirties (a process patended by John Todd & Rowntree Ltd.)OK.. for those not following where I am heading let's think about this. A process that pump air into 50% of the chocolate bar. A 3.6 oz bar can now be manufactured with 1.8 oz worth of chocolate. That's right folks.. the air bubbles occupy space, space which otherwise could have been occupied by real chocolate.If you don't mind paying for two bars of chocolate and only getting one, this product is for you."
2,I bought the scarf as a christmas gift for a friend and she absolutely loves it. She says the scarf is very soft and comfortable. I couldn't be any happier with the purchase!
1,This product would work better if the trays stayed in place and the gel could spead over your teeth evenly.I found even after five days the bottom tray hard to keep in place and most of gel going down my throat!The whitening/pain ratio is about the same as Crest strips. I found minimal irritation with average results.Please take back to the DRAWING BOARD for better results!
1,"Like many others here, I'm fed up with movie studios ripping off customers. 99% of us support them thru attending theatres and buying the movies legally (Blu-Ray, DVD, digital, online, etc.). Granted, 1% are guilty of pirating and it costs the studios $$. But that is NO excuse to take advantage of legitimate consumers.If a movie has been or is expected to have additional footage incorporated into an ""Extended Version"" or ""Director's Cut"", the studios should include both the original theatrical version AND the extended/director's version on Blu-Ray.Only by choosing NOT to buy until the studio releases discs with BOTH versions available can we stop this ongoing rip-off."
1,I was not prepared for the bad sound. But as a diehard fan this was an important add to my collection. Nice to have the collected to one item. Very nice booklet.
1,"Got my new saw out of the box, fueled and oiled it up. Followed the directions on starting... so far so good. Engine started right up. I let the engine warm up for a few minutes... went to make my first cut, pull the trigger and the engine died. Ok, no problem, start it back up again, which it did. Pulled the trigger and it dies again. This was my whole day with it. The saw runs great at idle, but the moment I try to make a cut, the engine dies. I eventually get it to cut with some work and pumping the trigger, but as soon as the cut is finished and I release the trigger it dies. I get very tired after an hour of repeatedly having to restart the thing.... so by the end of my first day with it and less than 2 hours of use, the engine still runs, but the chain won't move. It's as if the chain brake is stuck. Anyway, it's going back in the box and back to the store. I should have listened to my dad and bought a Stihl."
1,"Nothing wrong with the doll. Since we collect these Holiday Barbie dolls, we were disappointed that the case was cracked. Seller did not disclose this in the description."
2,We have used Braun Coffeemaker for many years and were unable to find it in the local stores. We like the styling of the new one and the ease of use. It makes perfect coffee every time and keeps it hot. Delivery was prompt. We highly recommend this product.
1,It was announcing the whole collectionand I received only one DVDI communicated and I will be reimbursed 100%still waiting for my reimbursement...
1,"I wouldn't buy any more of these. It's hit and miss when it comes to putting sockets in them. Not all of them fit in order, and the holder takes up lots of space in a tool drawer."
1,"I thought this workout video was completely lame. I'm holding out hope that the postnatal is better than the prenatal. I'll find out in a couple of months. There was absolutely nothing challenging about it. Especially the yoga fat burn. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to lose weight, but I am trying to stay fit. Doing the same sequence of poses 6 TIMES and moving on to a stretching section is not my idea of a workout. BOR-ING! The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one star is becasue of the opening dance/cardio section. Cheesy, but effective in getting your heart rate up. This video needs variety - big time.If you want a real ""workout"" get The Perfect Pregnancy Workout vol. 1. If you want real yoga, get Prenatal Yoga by Shiva Rea."
1,"I had one of these two years ago that worked great and is still working. My most recent purchase is okay, except that the scroll ring mechanism is sticky and gets stuck when you try to smoothly scroll. It is annoying. I will be sending it back for repair soon."
2,"I have been using Pinnacles products since version 7. If you want basic video editing, this software does a great job. In addition, there are advanced capabilities if you did deep enough into this software. One note of caution, once you install the software make sure you connect and get the latest update which is currently 10.6. As in the past, the initial releases (7,8 and 9) are not that stable out of the gate. However once you install the latest updates the software is very stable. There is also a user forum on the net where you can ask questions (huge forum!) and look for tips that others have posted."
1,We were trying to find movies with Alex O'loughlin and there aren't that many. We saw that he could really act in Moonlight but you won't see that in this one. There is a crude scene also that is just something they put in it. Guess they thought it would help. Well it didn't and as a matter of fact it almost turned us off him.
1,"Omg, I watched the movie ""The Amazing Spiderman"" last night. That movie sucks BIG time ! The story is so bad, the acting is so bad, it repeats things that happened in the first Spiderman movie and totally changes others. I can't believe people gave it a 4-5 star rating ! Keep in mind that I love the 3 Sam Raimi Spiderman movies, Sam R is a genius !"
2,"this music wraps around me. I can't say exactly what it is that makes it so special- lal's raspy expressive voice (a highland's billy holliday!) or the odd, simple arrangements- with their birdlike swoops and eccentric phrasings. both i'd guess- the prophetess chanteuse from the sacred well!"
1,"This book was a real disappointment to me. It is clear that it's written by the clergy and goes on as if everyone does exactly what they're supposed to do. Of course we know this isn't true for us lay people and it sure isn't true for the clergy either! To live up to our ideal is the goal, but everyone knows this isn't possible all the time Faith is a struggle. Catholics know this perhaps more than anyone--reconciliation is a sacrament! I recommend the Comnplete Idiot's Guide to Catholicism as it portrays the Catholic culture, what Catholics believe and what they do about their beliefs. It even covers places of disagreement among Catholics. Many people don't realize that Catholics don't all beleive the same way. The Idiot's Guide presented Catholicsim in all its lively fullness."
2,"this one's the best book to study for the NCIDQ. but they need to make an updated version. i just took the ncidq and items on the test but not in the book were drapery, carpet and wallcovering calculations and sustainable design."
2,This was the first book I bought on dog training. Its great because it covers a broad range of topics and is very easy to read. I got noticable results with my dog from their training techniques.Its a good introduction and starting point from which to then go on to more specialized books.
2,"A true timeless love story about Henry, an inadvertent time traveler, and Clare, a woman who's loved him since she was a child. Niffenegger crafts an unusual, but moving story of two star-crossed lovers that will stay with you long after you've read the final page."
1,The author displays a complete disregard for the teachings of the Catholic Church (either pre-Vatican II or post-Vatican II)and instead offers recycled stereotypical nonsense of Catholicism offered by the same pseudo-religious Protestant preachers who seek to discredit the Church.One might actually gain a better knowledge of the Catholic Church by reading:a) The Bibleb) The Catechism of the Catholic Church(Something that the author of this book has obviously not done)
1,"We bought this model to replace an older B&D that quit on us. The new model is slow. Over 12 minutes to brew a pot. It steams up the windows in the kitchen. The old one never did that. The pot dribbles when you pour it if you don't open the lid a little, then you get steam directed on your hand. When you set the timer you can barely see the tiny ""timer"" light. I could tell if the timer was on on the old one from across the room. It was very inexpensive and it makes a descent cup if you are willing to put up with all the other issues. Oh yeah, it seems to only come in black."
2,"I have listened to Too $hort since I can remember. Too $hort is the man, he knows how to rap and he is not afraid to tells it like it is. When our generation is in the old folks home, and pull out than old box of memories we will find his cd and start rememberen all the good and the bad times we had back in the dayz. I have to tell you about this one time I was listening to him. I was supose to be in school but I skiped that day I was comeing back from my boyz house and I totaled my parents new car and the last thing I remember when I relized what happened Too $hort was still playen in the totaled car."
2,"This sequel to ""Flowers in the Attic"" is a very pleasant surprise, given that ""Flowers"" was no literary achievement or even a very interesting soap, since its aspirations to be the Gothic Anne Frank were too high. Here, V. C. Andrews hits her stride, realizing that the Gothic horror is more effective combined with soap-opera romances than war history rewrites. The story is again first person, narrated by Cathy, but since our protagonists are not sequestered in the beyond-boring attic, the action and dialogue are ten times more involving. If ""Flowers"" was a long hibernation into inertia, ""Petals"" is a true page-turner, an edge-of-your-seat adventure. Overall, this is the book that ""Flowers in the Attic"" should have been, had V. C. Andrews spiced it up with more characterization. END"
1,supporting legs are much shorter than wheels. Doesn't hold balance even when it is empty. impossible to use. would not recommend
1,"This edition I bought, being the 3rd or 4th edition (its not stated) reprinted in 1982 by TIMES BOOK INTERNATIONAL SINGAPORE is badly reproduced as the photos are not as sharp as the original edition (published 1957 by Donald Moore Galleries Singapore and printed by MacGibbon and Kee, London).Also some photos have been replaced and not stated so accordingly nor acknowledged anywhere in the book. Very disappointing!"
2,"When I imbibe in my nightly drink of the moments' pleasure, I want to set the class down on something sturdy that will not shift or spill. This coaster set is perfect for stability and your glass will not slide off. With it's stainless steel framework it has a very classy look to it.Jay Adler"
1,"I found the book annoying for example the so-called hero had these episodes where he could only be calmed by sucking at the heroine's breasts,most of the situations were demeaning to both sexes ,there was very little genuine tenderness or feeling. If it was meant to be Science Fiction it was a flop, witness the scene where the woman gives birth to an egg that contained their children, as for erotica, it left me feeling kind of queasy - in one village the women were not only forced to go around naked they also had to wear collars and leashes ,in another section they had to sit with their legs wide open exposing themselves, I guess it caters more to the bondage crowd,but to me the prose itself seemed rather unimaginative and juvenile.I guess this really does come down to personal preferences"
1,"I truly expected this soundtrack to display much, much more of the Massive ""sound"" than it has. Deep into the disc, I found myself feeling very bored and disappointed that I was lured into buying this soundtrack because it read ""Massive Attack"" on the jacket. MA, this is not.While certainly without the well-known name on the front, it would have been a relative success. In actuality, it's not a bad soundtrack, it's just that I expected more. Fans of MA should understand how highly they've raised the bar over the years and to hear ""Danny the Dog"" is quite a let down.Maybe the lack, for the most part, of vocals is a key downer. Maybe the absence of a driving rhythm or beat is the problem. Maybe it's a little of everything...or maybe it's the fact that it's a soundtrack, music made to fit a movie and it's not going to be as cohesive as an actual studio release.In any case, this disc is pretty much only for MA collectors."
2,"This is a killer album. It isn't the freshest album in the world but it kicks and sounds great on the system in my car. Lots of thumps, killer vocals and some gritty lyrics. Malaise mix elements of Suspiria, Sisters, Fields of the Nephilim, and a lil industrial and bring something somewhat fresh to the table.If you are into bands like Apoptygma Berzerk, Wolfsheim, Fields of the Nephilim and the Sisters you will love this cd, since it has elements of all of the above."
2,"The book shows very good understandings and exercises in order to avoid neck pains. Same exercises are found similar to the ones given by my physical therapist. Also, some extra exercises that I don't receive from my PT. If you have severe neck pain, then the book might not help but it still give you some source of what caused your pains. In general the book is very helpful."
1,"Just saw 'em live at Irving Plaza. I never thought I'd see the day when Kittie out-pummels Candiria. Their new material is like MTV emo-nu-metal. Worse, they water down their older stuff -- played slower, with death metal and hardcore vocals replaced by rapping."
2,"Once again, Obie Bermudez delivers a subtle but effective approach to his distinct musical style, which--in spite of his exclusive use of an effusively poetic rendering of the Spanish language--transcends the Latin genre. Who but Obie can make a harsh exchange of words (""Maldita Boca"") or a tragic ode to an historical Mexican film figure (""Chapulin"") have infectious pop hooks that make you want to play the songs over and over? Overall, ""Todo el Año"" is not as powerful an album as ""Confesiones"", but Obie does not disappoint with this 11-track offering. And, although none of the individual tracks may measure up to the multigenerational appeal of ""Antes"" (from his ""Confesiones"" album), ""Todo el Año"" gets you jumping, dancing, crooning, and revelling in sweet melancholy as soon as the first few notes begin to play. Definitely a great purchase!"
2,"Great movie!I didn't know what to expect but ended up enjoying every minute of it! Some of the humor is slap you in the face funny while other parts are quite subtle and touching. I've seen it twice and will be watching it again!Fun movieI'm sorry that this movie didn't get the rave reviews that Greek Wedding did, because this was a fun, forget-your-troubles movie. I never got bored and my tickle bone loved it, too.Also Recommended: Greek Wedding, to wang foo thanks for everything"
2,"Look, if you're ordering this ink, it's because you need it, and probably, because you know it is the highest quality. So the real point her is that Amazon has the best price (or they did when I bought this)."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TUB!!!! It leaks all of the water out in a matter of seconds. I am going today to buy a new one. DO NOT BUY IT!!!!!
1,"The music is pretty good (though still not as good as Ben Folds Five), and the DVD features are kind of a cool bonus. But frankly, I would rather have had just the music in a format that would play on all my CD players. The audio side would only play on 2 of the 4 players I tried it on (haven't tried my car yet which is obviously important)."
2,"This old 60s show is pretty chessey, even for the time, but it was very popular in my area. As young kids we loved the action, and as teenagers we loved the Moon girls! How nice to revisit the show after all these years. The DVD set is pretty basic, extas are pretty sparse since it is such an old show, but the transfers look great."
2,"Having Quality and Right About Now, this is his weakest overall album but it is still great. The production lags a little on the weak cuts but the good cuts are superb. If your looking for something that you don't listen to everyday on the radio and a breathe of fresh air in this rap mess I would advice you to pick up all of Talib's cd because he is the BK MC.TOP 3Going HardI TryBlack Girl Pain"
1,"Lights are not made for the Northest. With sporadic sunlight, cloudy winter skies and inconsistant sunlight, performance is very POOR. I have yet to have a full night of actual lighted walkway. Not happy at all with the overall performance."
2,The book was good. It has nice pop ups and colorful pages. They keep my 1 and 3 yr olds attention well. My 3 yr old likes to see how the pop ups work and therefore many have come apart... but really they came apart more from the abuse rather than normal wear and tear.
1,"This tea infuser does not work with smaller pieces, as in the Teavana Rooibos Chai + Mate blend. All the grit just made its way out of the ball.Also, it's not totally easy to get the two halves back together again, though it is possible.I'd leave this tea ball for larger loose-leaf teas, and for when you're not in a hurry!"
2,"As a homeschooling mom of 7 I can authoritatively say that Melissa and Doug products are the best. So sturdy and durable but realistic at the same time. Read the book The Doll People (or listen on tape) while your little ones play. With these accessories my 3 littlest girls (6, 7 and 9) imagine that their dolls are real and play at night with all the of the food, plates, silverware, and use the lamps and toys. You can't go wrong with this company all around."
2,"Taken from the inside cover - ""A red Ferrari Dino speeds down a coastside Californian highway. Its' roof is down and the driver's blonde hair is ruffled in the breeze. As the waves crash in on the shore his companion - with the somewhat longer brown hair - pushes the cartridge into the eight track and some groovy sounds fill the air. The couple could be Ali McGraw and Steve McQueen, and the soundtrack should almost certainly be Corduroy."" If you are interested in getting a taste of the music that Corduroy make then this is a good buy. All the favorites are on here. Acid Jazz at it's greatest! It is a shame that they have broken up now. This best of does not include anything from ""The New You"" album or ""Clik"" but I those 2 albums are very different to what the first 3 were. Hard to find a band that compares to what Corduroy does - if you know of some let me know!"
1,I purchased this item over a month ago and have yet to receive it. I have sent three e-mails to the seller and have not received a reply. Many others have had this problem with him. I would stay away from this vendor.Roger S.
1,I agree with the two previous reviewers. This is indeed horrendous fake swing that doesn't hold a candle to the original masters. It is also GRATE (not great) modern swing!
1,"Haven't had a chance to watch the movie yet, but was very disappointed when I received it to open and find that the disc is front and back, making it necessary to stop the movie halfway through to turn the disc over. Definitely would not have purchased it if I had known this up-front."
2,"""A reader, August 23, 1998"" writes in his review exactly what you might expect from people who are (to say the least) not open for new insights and ideas. ""while the real scientists are busy..."" ==> busy doing what?! Busy hiding from revolutionary ideas that's a threat to what they were taught? REAL scientists would jump on the challenge thrown at them to look into the fascinating world they had closed their eyes for. It's (seemingly) far-fetched ideas that can mean breakthroughs and revolutions in what we know about the world's history.So don't let yourself be put off by such narrowminded disregarding and open up. Maybe there's a whole lot more than what we have been taught to believe..."
1,But no comparison to the later version. I was surprised to see so much of the dialog the same.
2,"This book is the kind you can pick up and read a few stories, puns, poems that will give you a ""light"" feeling, one you can enjoy what you read, my husband is not a reader at all, but he picked this one up just to see what it was liked and loved it. I read alot, and it is based on short stories that will give you something to think about during your day, you will find yourself smiling, remembering something you read in it. The kind of book you can switch around and pick out what you would like to read instead of a chapter after chapter book, I believe you will enjoy this one, and be searching for more like this one from the author. I certainly am waiting for the next one. It truly is light reading. Grab a cup of coffee and sit and read a few places in the book, laugh, smile, put it to memory and enjoy it. That is what it was written for."
2,This game is simple from days gone past. Still worthwhile and fun. But don't pay $100 or more... The folks who wrote the software for the original game make it available on-line for $39! Check out deltatao and support the folks who write the software.
2,I've read many books on Trafalgar. This one stands out for its clarity. The dangers the first RN ships to break the line were in are highlighted while the Allied re-taking of some prizes is told more clearly than I've seen before. The author's handling of Collingwood is very evenhanded.
1,"This hard to understand and self-indulgent meditation holds a lot of promise. However, the reader gets lost in a sticky world of SAT words and muddy thoughts as soon as he/she opens the book. Good luck."
1,"This 6 DVD set of ""Lord of The Rings"" is nothing new, if you have any versions you have what is in this set! The two or three features added are not worth the price. For me, a big Tolken fan, there is no better version than the extended edition. Once you have seen that one, it's hard to see the theatrical version and the extended version should have been released on Blu-ray. No doubt, I expect to see it soon! Wait, buy that version, it's two extra hours divided by three movies, fifty minutes alone of ""Return of the King"" and it is outstanding!"
2,This movie is deserving of soooo much more recognition. Jolie is absolutely wonderful in this role and very deserving of an Academy Award. Clint Eastwwod and co did an incredible job of bringing such a sad story to the screen. It is a must watch start to finish.
2,"Love the cd, the words come from a deep place. Something missing in todays music.Great.Would like to hear more from her."
2,"I loved this book, and it contains amazing photographs of a beautiful woman.She is a legend and it's easy to see why...A+++"
1,"Slow paced until two-thirds into the story, much time unnecessarily spent on Creasy's pre-revenge training, and a third act which, though fast paced, remains somewhat devoid of genuine surprises. In all, a well-written but quickly forgettable book."
2,What a great deal for a great price. Stop eating flavored High Fructose Corn Syrup when you can get all natural Real Maple syrup at this price.
1,Unreal Tournament is a far greater game. I found this game to be bland as it hasn't changed much from the original quake. Also Unreal Tournament has native support for Glide which allows me to run the game at a much higher resolution. Unreal Tournament also has 5 differnet game modes whereas Quake 3 only has Deathmatch and Team deathmatch (although eventually capture the flag will be added). I'm going to spend my money on the full version of Unreal Tournament and keep Quake 2.
1,"Although most of the songs are well written, Miss Rowland does not do the song writers justice. Her voice lacks depth and is not strong enough to carry a solo album (although nowadays, that doesn't seem to concern the music industry). With the negative press in the past concerning Destiny Child, Miss Rowland had to put out a solo project. My suggestion is more vocal training before attempting a sophmore project. I was hoping this project would put Miss Rowland on the map as a force to be reckon with as a female solo artist --- well, maybe next time."
1,"This CD [stinks]! I just listened to the clips on amazon, and the lady singing sounds like she doesn't even have an R and B background.Such disrespect to a beautiful singer."
2,"We were getting ""no disc"" messages with some DVDs with our Philips DVD player, and it was getting worse. It seemed that the newer discs were more of a problem. After using this Lens Cleaner, we haven't gotten any more ""no disc"" messages and everything is playing now. I guess it worked!"
2,"It's ashame that not too many people know Imx, and that it's not jammin BET and MTV, but this album is better than B2K, Sisqo, and soooo many other R&B artists! My favorite joints are: My First, Hate the Playa, Beautiful(You Are), and First of All. The first time I heard them was on B2k's top 25 countdown, and ""Stay The NIght"" was their number 2 pick, then "" My First"" was on TRL, and suddenly, "" Beautiful"" was on TRL. After that, I HAD to buy the album!! PEACE OUT!"
2,"I used this book during my studies, but also now I use it often to check some things. The book is written generally - it does not go too deeply into detail - but is still a good reference for a lot of questions."
1,"This product can easily be replaced by other mild cleaning products for your hardwood floors. It seems like watered down windex and mild dish soap in a spray bottle could replace it.On the other hand, the REPLENISHER offered by Bona is a fanatasic product to refresh the luster and shine to your hardwood floors."
1,I definitely recommend that you stay away from this product. I just purchased this product and was very disappointed with its performance. It cooked the food way too hot to the point of burning. This would have happened if I had'nt been home to watch it. It cooks too hot to be left unattended. It spattered the broth of my roast all over the counter and I had to fill it up with water twice to keep it from burning. The lid was horrible because it rattled from the broth boiling. It is very dangerous when chilren are around. It is too easy to get burnt from the splattering liquid. I am returning this white crock pot to the store for a full refund and going back to the old faithful model. I give this no star rating.
1,"As a recently reunited adoptee experiencing a broad range of emotions, I looked to this book to help aid in the healing process. I just did not like the writing style. In this book, Lifton describes the thoughts, feelings, and experiences of a few as being universal. I was looking for validation of my feelings rather than more reasons to become angry and resentful - which is what happened with this book. The final straw for me was reading Lifton's words, ""...adoption is abortion after birth."" I quickly discovered this book was going to do nothing for me except make me angry and resentful toward others for my ""place in life"" rather than helping me work through my feelings about MYSELF.If you are looking to get a grip on, and understand, your feelings, you should check out the book ""Being Adopted: The Lifelong Search for Self."" This book doesn't put ideas in your head, but instead helps you work through the ones you already have, in an easy to read, comforting manner."
1,"I just finished ""Stage Door Canteen"" by Maggie Davis and I can't understand why it got such great reviews. I found the characters flat and uninteresting. The story follows three women as they work at the famed Stage Door Canteen in New York City during the war and the men that they meet.Besides not liking the characters at time I felt that I was getting a Broadway history lesson about the show Oklahoma! I really love books set in World War 2, but I found impossible to like ""Stage Door Canteen"""
1,"My daughter is a year old. We got the walker a few months ago. My husband put it together, we helped our daughter hold on to the handle and it flew out from under her like a bullet!She would sometimes crawl behind it and push it. But, she got bored with that. Now that she has started walking she doesn't pay any attention to it. We fixed it where she can sit on it and push herself along, but her legs are too short. She threw balls into the basket a couple of times, but she has another toy that she can throw balls in that she likes a lot better.Also, the annoying music comes on so easily. All you have to do is walk near it and it goes off.We're getting her something different soon."
1,"I am usually a very satisfied person, but these speakers didn't make the cut. I should have listened to what others have said about these speakers. They really are junk, and I finally threw them out the other day and replaced them with a nice set I got at Sears. Anyway, the worst part is that the volume cuts out when you turn it down a little ways and they sound terrible! It is either too loud or you get no sound at all. I feel bad for my computer-the speakers weren't worthy!"
2,"These Champion thermal or ""long"" underwear are the best brand I've ever bought and I've decided not to buy any other brand anymore.They arrived so quickly I could hardly believe it. They are so sturdy and look good at the same time (though of course they are under all other clothes! hehehe)Other brands I've bought, you know the kind that are crinkled up like little tiny squares all over? They just get ripped apart in the wash. Not these Champion ones!NOW WE GET TO TURN DOWN THE HEAT AND STAY WARM AND COZY AT HOME!"
2,Marly's Choice is a the first book in one of the most emotional and erotic series of books I have ever read. It features the August Brothers who suffered abhorant abuse as young men and how this effects the brothers and the bond between the woman they love will have to be special - this first books is a fabulous start and a must for those that love a book that will grab you and keep you within its craps from page to page - This is a keeperand from the one of the most talented authors I have ever had the honor to readThis book is a Keeper
2,"As much as I hate to bring down that 5-star rating, I simply couldn't ignore the apostrophe abuse that didn't get edited out of the first several stories. Even a major pet peeve like that, however, could not keep me from thoroughly enjoying Michael Mallory's tales of Amelia Watson's adventures. Each story can stand on its own merits quite well, but they are especially effective collected into one volume. Having read only a few recent MIMM publications, I was pleased to be able to go back and start from the beginning, and I look forward to Vol. 2 with a great deal of anticipation."
2,The built-in bra is actually functional (not just a shelf bra-lette); the fabric is smooth and cool; the neckline is perfect for sexiness without going to low; the top is perfectly form-fitting even with my exaggerated proportions. It is SO difficult to find nice camis for busty-and-thin ladies but this one is great. I just wish I could get it in more colors!
2,"Like many of the other reviewers I watched this as a child on late night television. I was scared witless for about three months, following my parents around at night, grateful that we did not have a fireplace but keeping a cautious eye on the wall heaters. I eventually got over it but this movie has NEVER left me. I wish this was available on DVD!"
1,"According to the liner notes (which someone scanned and posted online), this is the SAME mastering job as on the 1996 re-release. The credits even state in this 2006 issue that it was mastered by Bob Ludwig in 1996. Yes, John Kalodner said in an interview that he and Steve Perry were updating the Journey albums to 2006 audio standards, but unfortunately that was not true. The packaging is new, but if you're an audiophile looking for updated sound, you're not going to find it, so save your money. I give one star for the pure silliness in reissuing the exact same disc under the illusion it is a sonic upgrade."
1,"I really like historical movies specially with some action. It was really a big challenge to finish this one. I think the entire dialog of the movie consited in less than two wriiten pages. Now, if you want something to help you sleep, then this is the one you need."
1,THe poster was ok but the packaging was awful causing the poster to get damaged during shipment. Very dissapointed !
2,"I bought this for my husband and he loved it, said it was a wonderful book. He has recommended it to many friends."
1,Went thru two in a week! And it almost set the house on fire!!! Motor burned up both times!! CUISINART RECALL THIS PRODUCT BEFORE SOMEBODY DOES BURN DOWN THEIR HOUSE AND DIES!!!!!
1,Most of the songs are cut off and/or talked over by Mike. Fire the editor on this one . I wish I could find the cuts and paste them back. Nice try but no cigar.
1,One setting doesn't toast the toast at all and the smallest increase in setting causes the toast to burn. After 6 months it began to burn EVERY piece of toast no matter the setting.The 5.00 toaster at Dollar General is a better toaster.
2,My first exposure to J-M J composition. Very good variety in types of music. Excellent blend of classical with electronic.
1,This author always has to have some sick twist of incest in every book she writes! The books come out good but the incest gotta go.
2,This is the best book I have found of its kind! A workout plan just for soccer players that is clear and easy to understand. You can use this program at any skill level and see results fast. Definitely worth the price - I have introduced this program to my whole team!
1,"My first unit was also DOA, second worked fine for 11 months and then failed. It registered ok with the T6c watch but erratic / intermittent speed recording.The grooves for the battery cover are also a little flimsy - easy to strip off if you don't get it aligned just right.that said, the Suunto gear is great at recording data and providing feedback, just not so good at interval trainingCheers"
1,"I bought this item thinking it would be a great office sound system, which I could use to listen to CD music and the radio in my limited space. It is the worst electronic product I have ever purchased.When you listen to the radio there is constant background static which didn't go away when I tried to move around the atena or move the actual radio away from my desk (since I thought it might be computer interference). What is worse is that even when I played CDs you could hear the static sound in the background.In addition to the static problem, the sound just isn't that great.I was thoroughly disappointed!"
2,"Simply the best product that I am aware of on the market, especially if you travel...I've used this ExOfficio product exclusively since discovering them in 2005. My only negative comment is not about the boxers themselves, but that I cannot buy matching tees because at 6'7"", I need a tall size, which does not seem to be available."
1,"This book has been around for so long I finally decided to pick it up after such great reviews and recommendations from others. I found this book to be of NO help whatsoever. The stories in the book in my opinion have nothing to do with anything and the repetitive speaking is what actually made me not even want to continue reading. The entire book is just saying the same thing over and over and over again but in a different way, actually sometimes the same exact way. Page 1 of a book should not say the same thing as page 200. I just was really tired of all the same things being said I had to stop reading."
1,"I tried... twice. But both of these ""toy toothbrushes"" quit working. In the past I had a great experience with an older Sonicare toothbrush and was hoping for similar quality with this simpler, cheaper and replaceable battery powered device. No such luck. After a couple weeks it just stopped. Phillips was kind enough to replace it but the replacement also failed after a couple weeks. My advise is to avoid the Xtreme and buy the higher price device (or stick to the simple manual toothbrush)."
2,I'm a scouter and do a lot of camping. Summer camping almost always includes the presence of Mosquitos and sleeping can be a real challenge. What a difference the right equipment makes! I received this later than expected but the netting is in good shape.
2,"To those who think Billy Ray Cyrus was a one-hit wonder, I recommend that you give this album a listen. It contains several of his big hits (""Some Gave All,"" ""Could've Been Me,"" ""Busy Man,"" and of course ""Achy Breaky Heart"") and showcases his talents well. You might be surprised. This is one of my favorite albums. If you like Billy Ray, this is quite possibly the perfect album for you. Truly amazing."
1,"The only other of Toibin's books that I have read was ""The Master"", which I thoroughly enjoyed. It is brilliantly subtle; my slight and confusing attraction to Henry James has, probably, more than something to do with my reaction. My thought was that such a profound writer should have a few more equally enjoyable books under his belt. I was, at least as concerns this work, horribly mistaken. I did try to like this book. I kept waiting for some depth or maybe some honest emotion. What I got was intolerably lackluster 1st person in short 7 word sentences that drove me /batty/, and a 'love' that is more based on lust than anything else. There is not one drop of feeling anywhere, and this includes the protagonist's reactions to his political situation since he doesn't actually /care/ at all. I skimmed to the end of the book to see if maybe I might be missing something worthwhile, but found nothing that would have made this book worth having bought in the 1st place."
1,The outdoor sending unit stopped working after 6 months.Called the 800 unmber on the back of the unit. Theyhave no warranty and could 'care less'.
1,"The Wall Street Journal's Mossberg highly recommended this device as a way to improve the range and strength of an 801.11G wireless network.I replaced a Linksys G wireless router with this device and I can see no difference whatsoever.Not that it's bad ... it's not. It works just as well as the router I replaced, but that's not what I expected. There are just as many dead spots in the house and the strength in each of the rooms is no better."
2,Easy to use puton and wear. a good addition to my existing costume. for i have been needing some witch shoes.
1,"I have purchased three of these for our hotel to play an ipod through our sound system. These do not last for longer than a two month period before they stop working. It is a nice concept, but they continually break under normal use conditions. The remote begins to not work by saying ""out of range"", and there is nothing you can do but send it back IF it is in the warranty period. Do yourself a favor and choose a model not made by this company, as these DO NOT LAST. I will never purchase one of these from this company again. Total garbage."
1,"If I hadn't already read a couple of the books in this Hornblower knock-off series I wouldn't have finished AoV and I guess I shouldn't have. I kept waiting for things to get better. Honor doesn't show up as much (or as well) as I'd hoped and much of the book is burdened with political lectures and tell, tell, tell lumps of exposition. Where was the editor? Maybe the problem is that Weber is ""too big"" to edit, but golly this is a disappointingly bad book that will convince some folks to leave the series.If you've never read a Weber book, don't start here and if you're a Weber fan pick this up only if you gotta have the set. I gave my copy to the Glen Falls library book sale."
2,"I loved Free To Be You and Me as a child and I love it now as an adult looking back. As a young girl in the 70s, Free To Be taught me that girls could be anything they want and broke stereotypes for ALL children. It taught us all that are feelings were important and singing was a cure for just about anything. I love this DVD, but I am sad that they couldn't find room for Carol Channing and some of the others on the original record (found on the cd). This DVD is a must-have!"
2,"The GORILLAZ newest single, 19/2000, hit stores this summer. While listening to it, I was amazed at its contents - each track was completely different from the other, providing variety on even a small CD single. It has a little something for everyone, whether you like rock, soul, dance, hip-hop, or pop. I think that this little album is a true work of art that is rarely found in today's pop music."
1,leaks after diving down more than 5 feet. Water pressure affects the goggles and they scratch pretty bad too. omg
1,"This is an OK bag, but like many of Lowepro's bags/packs, the zippers are awkward and stiff to use. Bought it for a new Lumix LX-5, which fits very well. But the main compartment sits back toward the belt clip (which is nicely designed), so you have to struggle a bit to unzip and extract the camera. I may return it and go with a case logic or some case that's easier to get in and out of. This has plenty of padding, so much that it adds a lot of bulk. I like protecting my camera, but this is a compact point and shoot, so making it bulky defeats the purpose. Too many of LPs products seem to be better for storage of the camera equipment rather than using it."
1,Unbelievable that so many are unable to see throught this racist thug and his racist non-music. It's no longer about the color of peoples skin-wake up! It's about the culture and lifestyles they choose to adopt. And the parents who let their kids listen to this garbage must be either crazy or ignorant. It's sad that someone so poorly educated has such a powerful influence over the most disadvantaged.
1,"Zip wax used to be the only wax that could remove my hair clearly and completely. However, this seems to be new wax. This wax was grainy and a lighter yellow in color. Additionally, it did not remove the hair nearly as well as the old wax."
1,"This show is funny, but it is with all of the wrong things. It deals with sex, sex and more sex. That is not the only thing to make jokes about. I know several other struggling comedies on TV that can't make it even though they are absolutley amazing. How I Met Your Mother or 30 Rock are amazing shows that do not base their jokes strictly off sex. (Yes, they do contain it, but it isn't shoved down your throat over and over.)"
2,"This is simply a very good, very interesting book. Whitcomb has an excellent writing style that comes across as very personable to the average Joe. Don't pass up the opportunity to read this one."
1,"This is exactly the kind of book that makes some snobbish people think that thriller-horror & sci-fi books are trash. I was enticed by the idea and I aknowledge that the writer is genuinely in love with it, but, after all , this is a book and not a made-for-TV miniseries, so should be something more than a bunch of random action scenes with no real characters or substance. And the final part is totally ridicolous ! Above all, everything is presented with total absence of writing skills (the prologue! ) .I'd just save the part with the shark chasing the helicopter . You can read this early morning ,on a crowded subway car....."
2,Really good idea. Takes all the guess work out of leveling my trailer. I drive the truck with the trailer attached and the Wife spots for me and it makes it that much easier for her to help me level the trailer. Definitely keeps peace in the family...
2,Stillstort getting used to the clip being where i grip the pen. But LOVE the way it writes. Extra smooth. The ink also dries exceptionally fast!
1,"I was looking forward to getting this magazine in the mail and now, two issues later, I'm disappointed. It's a lot of really big projects in really big houses. One house of over 2500 sq. ft. was even discussed as small. The pictures are gorgeous but that's par for the course in magazines like this.I'd like to see something more realistic. Who has the money for these types of projects in these times? This is not the magazine for you if you're more of the DIY type."
2,"I have been reading this series with my 8 year old. She loves it. Story line is good, and she loves that it is about owls. Also has encouraged her to learn more about owls."
1,"This DVD just tries to push religion.That's it.If you want to buy a DVD pushing a made up view of the world go for it.They just anomaly hunt to support an idea they started out with ie that god made the universe.They make many more logical fallacies...It is a very dishonest video as it pretends to be science but is not.Why would you believe anyone who is dishonest?Who deliberately sets out to hide there true identity.You need to look in the extras Questions and Answers before their true identity is revealed pushing the Christian religion.When someone pushing an argument hides their true identity it usually means they have a weak argument and this is certainly true here.As a christians you are supposed to be honest, well hiding your identity makes a lie to this belief and so makes them hypocrites.A thoroughly deceitful DVD."
2,"This is more of an experiment with great results as opposed to scientific data which doesn't mean it isn't valid, just know it could be considered opinion. I agree with the Whole Foods approach to health and was very inspired to continue my healthy eating lifestyle and continue to learn all I can about food."
2,"My kid loves this book, as well as the others, like Bang Bang and Knock Knock. Every mom who has ever come over to visit at my home has noticed their kids go straight for these books and they have all fallen in love with it, so much that they have immediately gone and bought it for their little toddlers.My 20 month old, loves the sliding board books and since we began reading these he has learnt to say the names of the animals, and now he reads the book with me. He'll slide the picture out and say the name of the animal hiding, which makes it good fun and very interesting.It's also a very sturdy and interactive book for the little ones compared to picture and pop-up books, which my little one tends to tear and destroy with a few days.I highly recommend this book as well as the other's in this series."
2,"If you are familiar with the book, you know the story. This book has kind of become a family tradition. It was time to pass it on to a great-nephew...and the bunny was a bonus. (bunny is child-safe...no buttons). If you're looking for a sweet story to read at bedtime (over and over again) so it is eventually asked for, this is a great selection.Shipping was prompt and the product in brand new condition."
2,"What more is there to say? This movie rocks. It is an excellent film adaptation/complement to Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"" album, and it delivers a wonderful viewing and listening experience. I only wish the film hadn't scrapped ""Hey You"" from the musical line-up."
2,"I found the home/travel charger extremely useful. I don't have to worry about being able to access a computer to charge my Ipod, and I can watch videos while its plugged into an outlet so as not to drain the battery, only to have my Ipod die in the middle of a show."
1,*****This should be a five star rating but something happened when I wrote the review so I can't change the star rating. Suffice it to say that this is a very comprehensive book with wonderful black and white illustrations. A very useful guide for students of botanical art or for anyone interested in plants.
1,"I found this book a bit boring. In the beginning, the book is a little slow, and then the adventure picks up, and then slows down again at the end. I also thought that the book was on the harder side; there are lots of characters to remember and some of them have the very similar names, so sometimes it can become just a little confusing. I would not recommend this book to others because it wasn't interesting and it wasn't a page-turner. Historical-fiction lovers would probably find this to be okay though."
2,"This was recommended to me by my brother about 5 years ago. I have carried it almost everyday since then. Why? Because it is simply that versatile. I have used it for everything from fixing my house to working on my car to opening my computer. I have even used it at work when no one seemed to have a pair of pliers or screwdriver when it was called for. My brother works in demolition/construction and puts his tools through the worse torture I have seen and he still buys them. So why only 4 stars? For me the lack of a pair of scissors and a sunglasses size Phillips keeps it from perfect. However, the toolkit I saw offered might make this the best multi-tool out there."
2,This Black Stallion Returns is charming and delightful. I had seen the movie as a child and recently purchased it. I still got chills and tears came into my eyes when the race was coming to a conclusion. I will always consider this to be the best movie anyone can watch.
1,"I thought that it was very odd that a TAG Heuer Carrera Watch would cost only $149, even though it was used. I ordered the watch and then received an email from the seller asking if I read the ad description. Well the product description described the watch but as I looked further, I found that the seller is not selling the watch but is deceptively selling just the band. After I canceled the order I received an email from the seller telling me that I should have known it was too good to be true and that I would be hard pressed to find a watch under $2000. I just hope that the seller is not allowed to deceive other potential Amazon customers from what is normally a pretty reliable process. For someone that is serving their country in Afghanistan I do rely on the goodness of truth in advertising on Amazon. My money is earned at risk to my life."
2,"I have other Dave Eggar CD's which I think I like even better but overall, it's a good CD. Very relaxing."
2,"As a craniosacral therapist, I am constantly on the lookout for music that does not interfere with a clients process and possibly enhances it. This album is exactly that. The music swims through the room as the artists dance together in simple and seemingly exquisite bliss. My clients love it and after I bought this album, I immediately bought it for my closest bodyworking friends."
1,"I expected this book to be about the freshman year experience, based on the title and the way that the book began. However, the book ended up being more about broad strokes describing student life. The author did not live in a freshman residence hall and I am unsure if she primarily enrolled in gateway classes or not. Memorable aspects include her depiction of the student community being comprised of independent networks and the way students learn to manage college (cut corners) as a stragegy to manage their time."
1,"I have been engrossed in the lives of Anne McCaffery's various characters since I first read Dragon Song at the age of twelve. Fortunately, The Tower and the Hive is not the first book by her that I have read. The book lacks any sense of a cohesive plot and is filled with tedious narratives...I am not sure why I even bothered to finish the entire book!"
2,"I have tried a few Wireless (RF) Headphones for viewing and listening to TV while my wife is sleeping. I have tried some budget products as well as high-end ones. The Sennheiser RS120 is the only one I have decided to keep. The charging cradle is convenient, the audio quality is quite good, and the setup was quite easy. And, the price isn't that much more than some of the budget items on the market.On other models, the tuning feature could be painful and inconsistent. Each night, I would have to re-tune the headset with the base which was quite annoying. The RS120 was fairly easy and I don't lose the setting from night-to-night.Only thing preventing me from giving it full 5 stars is the noise leaking from the headphones. My wife is quite sensitive so I have to keep the volume low so as not to disturb her. Better sound insulation would make this a 5-star product."
1,The first time we brought this to the pool the plastic piece that keeps the front wheel on snapped off. The back wheels are too thin especially for the beach and sand. Not worth it!
2,"We found FIAR to be the perfect extension to home learning for our family. We have been able to find every one of the books through our library, sometimes using the intralibrary loan system, but we have found them all. I found so many activites to use for my 4/5 year old that we often spent 2 weeks on each book. We often used the subject to expand on and gathered more books on similar topics. We did not always read the book 5 days in a row, but adapted the suggestions for what fit us best. We loved the geography work, art suggestions, and my 4/5 yer old is learning language arts concepts...perspective, simile,to name a couple, that our others did not understand until much older. We do supplement with a math program, and are now starting a reading program.I would highly recommend these books to any new homeschooler, or to one who has found the strict textbook approach to not be working."
2,"This purse or wallet-sized card magnifier is fabulous. Perfect size and has it's own slipcase. Great price, too."
1,"I went through two of these very quickly. It's a shame, I wanted to like them. The sound is pretty decent but they are just too fragile. I wore them in the gym and for running out doors. They are very fragile and snap very easily"
1,"I read and loved Volume 1 of this trilogy and it inspired me to leave my first ever review on Amazon.What a huge disappointment this book was after the brilliance of A Star Called Henry. The plot seems to miander aimlessly though Henry's new life in America with the author using every opportunity to offer some hidden meaning to his words through over artsy pros. It's possible that some deep thinking English majors might like this approach but for me it was dull, difficult to read and monotonous.If you have read A Star Called Henry, I highly recommend you give this follow-up a miss so as not to spoil your impressions of the story."
2,"If you boil eggs... without an egg piercer... you are doing it the hard way... I want eggs smoothe and coming out of the shells well and not having to cook them to graygreen edging around the yellow. A piercer is esstential & this one is well designed and efficient. The ""LOCK"" function is good... safe as well as efficient. Easy to use. Good price."
1,"I suppose if you're just looking for fuel for your body or emergency food to keep in your trunk, then these would be okay. If I'd purchased this box of Balance Bars, I would've brought it back to the store for a refund. The taste was pretty bad, and the consistency was gummy/muddy. It's better if you have it with a full glass of water, although there's a very strong aftertaste. My husband took a bite and spit it out -- the same with my six year old. My two-year-old son, however, seemed to actually like it and will eat a bar as a snack if I broke it up into small pieces. I just couldn't get past the taste. I still have over a box left, which I'll dole out to my son as snacks, but it's defiantly not something I would ever buy or recommend. In fact, if someone told me they were going to buy them, I'd ask if they'd ever eaten them before and if not, I would tell them pick a different product. Big thumbs down on this one!"
1,"I think watching this movie actually lowered my I.Q. I'm a fan of really bad movies. I actually own ""Boxing Helena"" and ""Sliver,"" so you can see that my tastes tend towards the corny... But this movie was soooo bad that not even I could find anything of redemptive value in it. It seems to have been written by ninth-grade boys who were high at the time. The special effects also seem to have had about a comparable budget. I only made it through the first hour of this movie, mainly because I was too paralyzed by the sheer awfulness of it to get my frozen finger to press the ""off"" button. If I were Jude Law, I would make it my life's quest to hunt down every copy and burn it."
2,"Another fun movie from Toho. Good effects, interesting special features. Fits well with Godzilla movies made within the last few years. As always great minatures, and I enjoyed Kieth Emersons soundtrack. Keep the snickers down and just enjoy."
2,"This album entails a collection of live performances from Mary J. Blige; Mary shows why her live shows are always backed by positive reviews. The instrumentation is superb and flawless! The album concludes with a timeless rendition of Earth, Wind, and Fire's ""Cant Hide Love"". Mary gives us a first account of how she use to sing this song between the age of 6-9 in a deep baritone voice, just like Maurice himself, of Earth, Wind, and Fire would sing it!"
2,This car had (and still has ) a very powerful odor from the wheels.It is not a terrible smell but certainly should have eased once the car was removed from the box. It makes one wonder about the material that was used to construct the wheels.Assembly took more than an hour (the last steps caused the problem with parts that had to really be forced together). Instructions were very good.
1,"How could anyone possibly read any of this and believe that it is a work a literature, its nothing but propaganda full of mind altering lies. He wants you to believe that he is revolutionary aiming for a United Ireland, free from war. Heres the truth Jerry Adams is IRA, responsible for countless needless deaths of police officers, politicians and civillians both protestant and catholic. He has other members of IRA in his so called ""political"" party, murderers in goverment. Terrorisim is terrorisim, be it Palistine, Al-Qaeda or the widely believed ""romantic"" IRA. DO NOT GET THIS BOOK BY GIVING JERRY ADAMS YOUR MONEY, unless the price of toilet paper had suddenly rose!!!!!"
2,"Giora is arguably the greatest Klezmer musician in the world. He plays with a feeling and soul which move and surprise. He also seems to arrive at places with his clarinet where no one else can. However great it is to listen to him his music is enhanced by seeing him perform. So it is not enough to listen to even the best of his music but it is necessary to fully appreciate his work, to go and see and hear him play."
2,"One of the best movie's I have ever seen in my life. Im gonna watch it over and over again. This is a must buy for a DVD collecter. Sine your pitty on the runny kine, wadatah!"
2,"I bought this item about 12 years ago from an infomercials. After 11 years of foster care to 32 kids, and using at least once a week if not more, it finally lost the no-stick. I looked on Amazon and found it again and was very happy! Bought 2 this time. This is great for making not only eggs and pancakes uniform, but I make Mac Muffins for breakfast and mini-cakes and these work just fine. For the price they are wonderful. And...Amazon seems to find items 'older' and new items when other sites don't."
2,"After listening to ""ok computer"" you could guess where radiohead where going.From the ""mainstream"" sound too an even more ""deep"" and timeless sound.But you shoulld listen to it many times,coz every time it grows.There is so much soul(not the genre)in this cd.There are many incredible tracks but my favourites are 6 and 7.If you haven't gott it yett,go and buy it NOW!"
1,"This is a pretty bad movie.- The story is nowhere near novel- The director is incredibly bad- The writer is incredibly bad- The movie overall is pretty badDisney needs to understand that good movies are created by good creative artists, not bad ones (seems obvious but not to Disney). Please hire good people."
2,"***SPOILERS GALORE### Tom Wall was cool, John Wayne could have played him and I laughed each time at Simon's bad American accent. I loved the Sondegger character and especially his warm soothing voice which Vance nailed but especially pleasing was how realistic the book was - how SPOILER ALERT*****...how i main characters randomly just die like Rupert Davis Franks or the invincible supremely confident Duck Blind...just like in real life. The setting in Wartime foggy ol Londontown was superb.Harriet was the real double crosser and who saw that coming? No one I bet! I did predict the second microchip showing up iwhen Tom got his little ""Hand out"" however and was quite proud of myself.I think this is a story much better heard by a Brit like Simon Vance than read on your own, although Highcastle and Hariet's Dad sounded identical! Really enjoyed the 9 disc package!"
2,"This product is the second Kindle for this family. The device is simple to use; and it is trivial to change font size, order new books and retrieve archived items.The best feature is that it is easy to read even in the brightest light.I love my Kindle!"
2,"We love this movie, especially in the original classic black and white version. A must have for all fans. Would highly recommend."
1,"So unhappy with these people.. The originally send me the WRONG item, tried calling and emailing them and didn't hear back until like a week later or so. (via email) After receiving the wrong item, I immediately send it back and asked to get my return shipping refunded for $4.90.. /sigh I've still not received it yet. When they finally did contact me, they of course apologized for the mix-up and told me to keep the wrong item that was sent to me. This is after I had already sent it back mind you. I told them I no longer had it and wasnt looking into getting anything for free. ALL I wanted was my correct item and to be refunded for the return shipping.Still waiting... and waiting(one month ago)"
2,"I used to buy bottled water day in day out. Now I just own a few 32 oz wide-mouthed bottles, and I fill it up with my Brita filter. It is perfect! It was the best purchase ever!"
1,"But I kept reading thinking it just HAD to get better. I was wrong. I think Katie Macalister needs to slow down and give more depth to her characters, more thought to her plot and quit trying to please her publishers by putting out books like a writing machine.Also, her American heroine's use of British terms in coversation was annoying. And wouldn't any real American pack a pair of jeans when they travel?"
2,"I work in a Physical Therapy Clinic and we have two of these units. They stay on 24/7 5 days a week, and they do exactly what they're supposed to do -- lotion is always warm. The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5.. the lotion bottles that were included with the units were of poor quality.. the tops split or came apart within just a few months of use,and had to be replaced."
1,"There must be a polarity issue that I was not aware of, but using this & the loss of the sub-woofer in my amp seemed to coincide... Who knows..."
2,"Panama Rose was the pseudonym used by Ira Cohen's then-girlfriend Rosalind, the author of The Hashish Cookbook. (She and Ira were together from 1963, when they met in Tangier, until June 1968 in New York City.) The suggestion came from Brion Gysin.This is corrected information from Eddie Woods.

1,"I am experienced with crossbows, and I recently purchased this crossbow as a fun small bow to play with out in the backyard. Well, that never happened. The assembly was terrible. I dry fired (no bolt) this a few times and determined that it was not safe enough to put a bolt in to fire.I would recommend that you get a cobra brand 80lb crossbow if you are looking for a small pistol sized self cocking crossbow. They are much better made.80 Lbs Self-Cocking Crossbow Pistol."
1,"I've referred to this book several times over the last couple years and it has offered no help. Norton's book is too general to be of any use. I would rather have five books that cover just a few topics with depth and clarity than one book that skims many topics and helps me with none, like this one."
2,"This album is a beautiful introduction to an amazing singer/songwriter. I had never heard the man sing before, but was familiar with many of his songs. This album takes you from his earliest recordings to a last live performance which makes it a great collection for a newcomer to Tim Hardin's talents. The string additions to a couple of the songs are a bit annoying but basically it's a beautiful album. I am now a dedicated Tim Hardin fan and this album will help me to select from his others."
2,"Sent this to a three-year-old boy who is a great Bob The Builder fan. He sat right down and worked on it. Grandma wanted to help out, but his Mom said...give him a chance, he can do it. He did!"
2,"I love books that make you think and include fascinating, new ways of looking at the old. Shotokan's Secret is definitely one of those books! It's also an incredibly well written book that is a true ""page turner"". I really liked the original edition and this new expanded edition has a lot of new material and is also a must read; even for those who have the original. Whether you agree with the ultimate conclusion of the book or not, what is beyond doubt is that Bruce Clayton presents his case is a very engaging way, the book will really get you thinking about your kata, and reading it will definitely add a new dimension to your understanding of kata, bunkai and the development of karate. One of my favourite martial arts books of recent times!"
2,"This book is fascinating, very well written, and meticulously researched. It provides an authoritative analysis of Roosevelt's response to the Holocaust. I could not put it down. As Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. said, ""If there is a single book to read, 'Saving the Jews: Franklin D. Roosevelt and the Holocaust' is the one. This is an essential book for students of U.S. policy toward the Holocaust."" This book examines WWII, the Holocaust and FDR's perspective as events were occurring - in the context of the time. It helps the reader understand the reaction and response of Americans, American Jews, and FDR to Hitler's mass murder. It is a must read. Also, there are many footnotes and sources listed if the reader wants additional information on any particular point."
2,"My husband loves this show -- the fast-talking Broderick Crawford, the cars, the plots, the good guys win. It's sheer enjoyment and a step back to a simpler time in US history. A guilty pleasure -- yes, but aren't those the best?"
2,"This book is about how a single father ends up overcoming the death of his wife, finds love again, founds out what really happened to his wife that ended her life, and forgave himself. The shock for me in this book was how the woman he falls in love with was related to the kid that killed his wife. I can understand how he can't believe she didn't know but was just playing with his heart. Everyone has something they are keeping from other people rather it is how they really feel about something or a major event that happened. Forgiveness has to be done for the individual no matter how long the action happened. This book covers a lot but it is worth reading for anyone."
1,"I received the book and found that the DVD audio and video were not in sync. The CD would not open on my computer as it couldn't see anything in the drive. The disc did play on an old audio device I have so I knew the file was there. Thinking the discs were defective, I sent the book back for another copy with total cooperation from Amazon. Unfortunately, the exchange copy discs presented the same problems. Amazon could not help me, though they gave it it a good try; we agreed that exchanging my copy for a new one again would likely lead to the same problem again and that the defects in the discs were out of their control. I called the publishing company and did not find them to be helpful. I found this frustrating and disappointing, as I am left with a defective product with no recourse. I had been looking forward to getting the book/DVD/CD for months, fully expecting my previous experiences with McKenna's products to be repeated. This time was unpleasantly different."
2,"I have done a number of bellydance tapes, and this is one of my favorites. I love how Alexandra faces a mirror while working out so you can see what both your front AND back are supposed to be doing :-) You don't just learn to bellydance, you get a nice set of toning exercises for the arms, legs and stomach as well as a fun, easy low-impact aerobic workout. Not only does this workout help develop a toned body, it builds body awareness and confidence as well!"
2,"I found myself relaxing to the wonderful voice of Trade Martin's singing tribute to B.B.King's legendary music.The lyrics were composed by Trade Martin for B.B.King.Even though I'm not really into the blues this Cd could get get me hooked on it.It contains many wonderful classics I've listened to for many years and a great performance by a fantastic artist.As a poet I kind of ""met"" Trade through Poemhunter when I won a contest to name one of his poems and the prize was this CD.It will be one of my great treasures and something for me to talk about for years to come.Also I'll get to enjoy playing the CD when ever I want to with good feelings colored in the ""blues"".Thank you Trade.Five very well deserved gold stars."
2,"This was bought for my father for when he is in the hspital, Audio books are always good. ThanksLaura"
2,"Something happened to George Enescu, who had composed some pretty good music prior to WWI. Romanian Rhapsody No. 1 is fine fiddling, but some like Symphony 2 were so disorganized that it only had one performance during his lifetime and someone who didn't have to pay royalties brought it out after his death.The Symphony N. 2 does force me to concentrate, and to my amazement my blood sugar went down to 111 at 5PM. I was trying to make some sense out of it.As near as I can figure, Enescu tried to form a society that encouaged composition. Bucharest Philharmonic George Enescu Orchestra was named after him when he died in Paris in 1955. He has performed and recorded the violin reperatory after leaving Romania because of Soviet Realism's deadening effects. This 4 CD set has much of his published works."
1,"I have been an eel skin wallet user for 20 plus years. As mine was showing its age, I purchased this item.It arrived in a timely manner, looked well built... if you have miniature credit cards, drivers licenses etc.The wallet is so constrained in size that business cards would buckle when attempting to put them in.This is the first thing I ever threw away that I purchased on Amazon.com"
2,"The only thing is missing is the caller id feature, which is very important but the rest of the features are a great help."
1,"Although it maintains a rugged look, simply drop this watch and the minute and hour hands jam. Apart from that it had all other features I needed.I'm not the only one to have this happen."
1,"Burr grinders ARE much better . . . but only if they are sturdy enough to last! This one did fine for a few months, then the first thing that happened was the plastic gismo covering the blades broke ... then (probably because of the lack of the ""gismo"") the plastic container holding the beans cracked (while grinding, not from abuse!).And just today, the little burrs burred their last.Maybe mine was just a lemon -- you can decide the risks for yourself. :-)"
1,"This is the worst printer we have ever owned. We have owned many and at times printed hundreds of thousands of pages per year. The red on this printer became disfunctional after the first cartridge. Despite cleaning etc., it never revived. Oh, but it uses plenty of red toner, it just does not come out red on the page. The cartridges are outrageously expensive, and the last time I bought them, the brand new color ones came only half full. Not acceptable for an $80 cartridge. The thing is loud and cycles repeatedly to clean, calibrate or whatever. Then throw in the HP nonsense with their continuous updating and screwy driver jig for more fun.Throw on top of all that that HP now has some of the worst service in the industry, and you have an expensive piece of junk. I am tossing mine when the toner runs out the next time rather than spend over $300 for cartridges. Throwing $1000 in 20s off a bridge would have been a lot more fun."
1,"First, if you're expecting a terrifying, grab your chair, scream out loud horror film with a plot, good script, good acting or anything else good- DON'T WATCH OR BUY THIS POS! This just might be the worst horror film or any film I've ever seen. The story was written by a child, the so called actors couldn't get a job doing dinner theater, the special FX were weak and low budget to say the least and the direction was non-existant!!! The only redeeming qualities of the movie, and this is by a long stretch, are the shooting locations and scenery. It was set in Ireland but was shot in Connecticut and the locations are the only saving grace in this film. At least the DP shot great scenery and captured the beauty of Ireland.I would rate this film a 1/2 star on a 5 star scale. VERY BAD!!!!!!"
1,"I was looking forward to viewing this generally highly-rated documentary. However, the English subtitles are few and far between and are hugely abbreviated versions of the conversations taking place. I found it impossible to get more than a very vague idea of what was going on. I did not watch beyond an hour---that was enough. Shame on those making money from selling this so-called English subtitled DVD set."
2,"The DVD did not play anywhere. I tryed on 2 DVDs players and a computer.Could you please send a new copy to me? Also I saw on tv that they are offering the same product for $14.99 for a try-out, but I payd $299 for mine. What's going on?Thanks,Luiz Coelho"
2,This thing rocks!!!!!!!!!!!! You won't regret buying this. The problem is for gameboy advance games the colors look too vibrant. Other than that this thing rocks!!!!!!!! like everyone else says!!!! You should get mario cart ds. It's so much fun
2,"The Grace Card was a moving and touching story. Its challenges of faith and loving someone who is not easy to love. Many topics were addressed like racism, rebellous teenager, very difficult father struggling with the past. He was so bitter and angry, he took it out on everyone. However, God's grace has a way of breaking through and forgiveness is beautiful on the other side."
2,Great slide / film scanner. SilverFast software has a Mac feel in the Microsoft Windows environment and requires Quick Time software. You will WANT IT for removing dust and light scratches and adjusting color.
2,SO NOW AT LAST WE CAN SEE BLACK RAIN IN 16/9THIS MOVIE IS VERY GOOD AND NOT INALTERATE WITH THE TIME SO I AM SO GLAD TO HAVE SEEN IT IN 16/9 VERY GOOD SOUND AND BEAUTIFUL PICTURESO IT WORTH THE BUYING
2,"being that i am a huge chaka khan fan,i have to say that i enjoyed this dvd. on the other hand, i had to give it 4 stars because it was so short and the back up singers seemed a little off key at times. all in all chaka can do no wrong in my eyes. so if you are a fan, i recommend buying this."
1,Not a good attempt to provide cover for her favorite political desire but diverting attention to a well respected president.
2,I used this on both my sons. Jordan loved being wrapped up in . Gabon didn't like being so confined. I liked it and it made them so much fun to cuddle with!
1,"Well, lets just say everyone gets old and loses a step. You can tell the Boys put a lot of work into this album, but I think the long break between albums took them out of the game. And they have never really recovered. The almost addicting styles of the former albums have been replaced with something that seems kind of forced, and never really hooks you. You want to like it, you really do, but the discrepancies in the sound and structure of the songs when compared to what made you like the previous albums so much, is too much to overcome. If this is your first B boys album, you will prob like it. But if you are more familiar with their previous four albums, Hello Nasty and all the albums that have followed so far, are not anywhere close to as good."
1,"Nubile college babe strokes geriatric Jewish heart patient/once-hot author, causing him to have a stroke; meanwhile, author's obnoxious, unattractive 40-year old daughter, fresh off a binge of cheap sex while secretly trying to get pregnant by some poor unsuspecting schmuck, shacks up with a non-committal black narcissist who previously sent her to the looney bin, and at the same time opines that Dad's relationship is ""unnatural"". Many tedious scenes of author napping, eating slowly, typing, soiling his pants and even climbing out of the tub with gross old rear end in plain view. Oy vey!"
1,"This game is ok. Some tricks are to easy and some are impossible. I plated it in my cousins house. I refused to by it. It is stupid. I will never play it again, not even at my cousins."
1,"The English Dubbed Version of this movie [dtunk]. Yes, it did [stink]. I'm not kidding. They changed the following things in the dubbed version of this movie:1) All the music (except for some) were replaced with the DIC music cues.2) Everyone pronounces Princess Kaguya's name like Kah-GOO-Ya.3) Sailor Chibi Moon's name became ""Sailor Mini Moon"".4) Sailor Uranus' voice is too high-pitched.5) Sailor Neptune's voice is too old! Serena (Usagi)'s mom isn't a good voice for her...6) Sailor Pluto sounds like Britney Spears.7) The Sugar Stars (those things which Kakeru gives to Luna) are changed to ""Star Flakes"". (Sweat Drop)8) The Snow Dancers sound like annoying yapping dogs.9) Luna's HORRIBLE voice doesn't match her human form.AND MANY MORE!Don't buy this tape! If you're a Sailor Moon fan and saw the Japanese Version, don't buy this tape! Stay away! Buy the English Subtitled Version instead!"
2,"I love my Kindle sooooooooooooo much! It was probley one of the best gifts I have ever recieved! I have no complaints besides a few books I would like to read are not on it, but I sent a thing to the publisher to request that I would like to read it on my Kindle! Otherwise 2 thumbs up Amazon! I read more now then I ever have!!!!!!!"
1,"I'm not pregnant but I wanted a good organic vitamin and thought these would be the perfect one considering they're organic and had greeeat review. BUT PLEASE BE AWARE--ALLL I do is sleep all day especially on weekend when I am of from work.I need a viatmin that will give me strength to keep up with my daily routine not one that puts me in bed!I've try to take at night and do sleep like a babbby, however, regardless of that fact, I still am Sleepy ALL DAMN day.I wonder if I am the only one with this problem when it comes to this multi-viatmin.HMM?"
2,"I received this coffeemaker as a birthday gift. Although I wake up very early, I don't start ""percolating"" until that first cup of coffee. Therefore, when I received this gift, it was with great enthusiasm. Minimal effort produces a quick, smooth tasting cup of java."
1,"I would give this book zero stars if I could. The narrator is unlikeable and misogynist. His descriptions of his adult daughter I found frankly creepy. The prose is horribly overwritten - florid and clumsy, with unbelievably clunky dialogue.In general, if I buy a book on Amazon and don't care for it, I can't be bothered to return it; this particular book inspired me to pay the postage and send it back. Not recommended."
2,"This text takes a look at differences between communication styles of men and women. It is an academic text, full of statistics, studies, and so on. Nonetheless, it is an amazing source of information about the differences between communication styles based on gender."
1,This item is too short besides being too small. It doesn't fit well at all. At least it didn't cost too much.
1,"My husband and I chose to buy this monitor because we wanted something that would hold connection while we were outside, didn't have a bunch of background noise or static, and something that someone else could pick up on theirs. So, about 14 months ago when we got this, it worked really well at first, for about 6 or 7 months. Then, it started to beep all of the time. I lose connection to it when I am in the house! It is the most irritating sound in the world. I called Graco and they told me that it was because the battery went bad, so they sent me a new battery pack, and well, it didn't fix it. So, I really don't suggest buying this product!"
1,"The first feeder arrived with one side broken off and was immediately replaced by Amazon. However, the second feeder arrived and within a day of being hung, a dollar-size chunk fell out of the bottom. I exchanged it for a different brand. These look very cute but are poorly made."
1,"The Kindle edition is good, but the content is horrifying! We must know what these lunes wrote in order to know their followers of today. That is regrettable that someone truly believes on that nonsense. Our Universities are filled with that kind of discourse. We must be aware of it."
2,"Love that these are cotton - texture is great and they are actually much softer than they look. We don't actually use these for diapers. I bought them as ""temporary burp cloths"" while deciding on some others. I now use these exclusively. One thing I love about them is that they wash very well - I don't spray them with any stain remover and they come out clean every time simply using Dreft detergent.We also use them to ""catch"" my little boys' geyser, as my husband refers to it, during diaper changes. I think these would also be great for household cleaning as well (I'd use separate ones for those). These also make a great light-weight, breathable blanket for blocking the sun - we live in Texas, so this is a huge plus!"
2,"This novel is an excellent journey through the dark, disturbing wilderness of 18th century America and its dangers. The wars that raged between Natives and their oppressors (the English) are here brutally portrayed. With a new introduction to English literature of the effects of sleepwalking, this is also a journey through the psychology of a psychotic sleepwalker, and the devils that haunt him. An excellent read for those searching for the natural horror of humanity, with a little suggestion of the supernatural, though very heavy both in language, and symbolism and metaphor. A tough read, but well worth it."
1,"I got this movie for my 5 year old son because he quit believing in Santa so I was hoping to show him that Saint Nick was a real man at one time so maybe my son would at least know some where it all came from. It showed him a little bit but things need to be explained to him in a different kind of way. This movie basically just kept saying ""Maybe Santa is real and maybe he's not."" My son Knows hes not real (he's got a mind like a scientist, you have to physically show him things or he just doesn't believe. Everything needs to be proven too him) so this movie just wasn't for him. But I guess it was alright other then the fact it was not what I was looking for."
2,"Although the buying information indicated that this book was used, I believe that it was brand new! It is in absolutely wonderful condition. The book itself is great, too, but, being translated from French, there are definitely some interesting phrases to say the least"
2,"Would have gave it a 5 but because little things that need to be done I gave it a 4 because I do like it. I ordered 3 of the purse organizers and could not wait to organize my closet with this item. First of all whomever came up with this idea has a good thing going, but I wish there were different sizes like small, medium, large. I got all of my purses in the slots and because the other side is open the larger purses fit which is ok. But if someone re-makes these please have different sizes and make sure the other side is closed. But this is a great product for now."
1,"I was very excited when I found this deck.. The few card images displayed were quite beautiful. However, when I received it and started flipping through the cards I ended up very, very disappointed. First and mostly, I cannot figure out what the muscle men are all about. Ugly and distracting, not at all fitting.. don't get it! The courts, all the same exact picture/image, only difference in any suit is the color of the outfit the person is wearing. I misunderstood and thought the people were the same through out, NOT the actual scene. How boring and unimaginative! Also, mine have the black borders which I think take away from the artwork. Over all, the worst deck I own.. don't think I will ever use it. Thought about re-selling but would be ashamed of myself. If I could give this a minus or at least a zero I would."
2,"I got this book because it was an autographed edition. I really didn't think it would be of any interest. I was wrong! He gives a lot of good advice in personal finances. Some of it should be common sense, but it's amazing how quickly we forget the basics! I don't agree with everything he says, but I've already used some of his advice and it's working for me! What more can I say?"
1,None of the disk were broke on arrival. All disc did work properly. Good for making your own dvd's or using for files.My orginal review was a 1 star. Since it won't let me change it. Now I'm telling you it was a 4 star.
2,"I've been waiting for this DVD for decades.It's my absolute favorite version of Metropolis.Moroder did a fantastic job with the color tinting and music.I think even Fritz Lang would approve.If someone who was not aware of this great film saw only the Moroder version,they would think it is the coolest,hippest film ever!Now if they would come out with Cobra Woman and other Maria Montez movies....."
1,I was going to recommend this book to my book club and I am glad that I did not. I did not find this book to grab my attention.
2,"I saw this program when it aired in Canada. I live in the Detroit area, so I was able to see it from across the river. I enjoyed it very much and have been looking for a copy on DVD that is designed to be played in the U.S. So far, all I have found is PAL."
2,This is really well made. I've put many more tools in it than the number of pockets and it holds them just fine.
1,"Like many others who have reviewed this DVD boxed set, I was eager to buy it. I grew up watching WKRP In Cincinnati and have told my wife about it many times. I marked my calendar and showed up at a local store to buy it today.As soon as I read the back of the box, I put it back on the shelf in disgust.I refuse to buy a product so poorly handled. I would gladly have paid $10 more per set to have the original music intact. If Miami Vice could do it, the studio that owns the rights to WRKP in Cincinnati could have done it.This is sloppy, short-sighted, and inexcusable.KRP was a classic show that captured the spirit of the '70s -- music and all. There's no excuse for it to be butchered this way.When this boxed set is restored to its original state, I'll buy it. Until then, I'll be content to remember it for the classic that it was."
1,"This book is an array of simplistic information based on cognitive therapy. Instant revelations of one's point of view and correcting it do not a big change in life make, in my opinion. The writer seems to think so.I'm also tired of professional writers starting many sentences with ""But"" when the ""but"" should be connecting one half of a sentence with another, or the two thoughts should be separate sentences, either of which would work well, rather than repeatedly breaking rules of grammar in this way. Where are the proofreaders and editors?"
2,"If there's only one Elvin Bishop CD to have, it's this one and it cherry picks the best tracks (imo) Bishop recorded during his tenure at Phil Walden's Capicorn Records (1972-78).Don't expect a re-hash of The Paul Butterfield Blues Band here. Elvin was into soul, chitlin rock and funk with the occasional ballad thrown in during this period, so forget the twelve-bar white boy blues.Bishop was his own man and did what he wanted to do. Good for him and this CDs proof of that."
2,"This workout was perfect for me in terms of cardio and I have had a lot of fun with it. This is my first Billy Banks video and my first TaeBo. So does BillyB make some mistakes? Get over it! I am 56 years old, male, overweight, and at the same time in fairly good shape (round is a good shape:) Some of the combinations took some practice. Somethings I simply modify. All in all, my heart rate gets up in the zone, I sweat profusely, and enjoy the energy Billy and the gang bring to the workout."
1,"THIS WAS MY 3rd """"HAP & LEONARD"""".IT MANAGED TO OFFEND ?? SIX ?? DIFFERENT AREAS IN THE FIRST 5 PAGES.OKAY THE FIRST """"H&L;"""" WAS INTERESTING----THE SECOND WAS OKAY----NOW---OLD HAT!! I CAN SEE THAT THEY WILL ALL BE SORTA THE SAME---KINDA LIKE """"SPENSER"""" ONLY NOT NNNEEEAAARRRLLLYY AS GOOD."
2,"I've been through quite a bit of training in the stock market, but none of it has come close to the simplicity and effectiveness of this book. I wish I would have read this book first before even starting to trade - it would have saved me countless thousands of dollars and would have surely put even more countless thousands into my account. This book is based on common sense and really helps you to simply understand the market. It DOES NOT HAVE A TRADING ""SYSTEM"" IN IT. But, it is extremely easy to build one around the principles in this book. It has really helped me with my trading and my account shows it."
1,"This stinks! I ordered this ""Lexmark #32 / #33 Twin Pack ink Cartridges (18C0532)"" from Amazon / Ship it Depot Inc. in August and made sure they were the correct numbers when I got them. They did come in a zip lock bag, not the box pictured, but the numbers on the foil packaging are correct. However, today when I tried to install the color #33 cart., the printer tells me that it is the ""incorrect cartridge"". It looks identical to the one in the printer (that works) but it does not. My guess is this has a different country code on it and it will not work on my Lexmark x7170 in the US. Guess what, the return time has expired so I am now out of luck. If anybody can help, I would appreciate it. Based on this, I cannot recommend ordering any printer cartridges from Amazon."
2,"Its the best book available now for this test. Easy to read and it covers all the oficial topics. If you're looking a good Study Guide for the 216 test, this is the best choice!Unfortunatly, CD and Simulation Software that comes whitin is not so good. You can not review your mistakes after taken a test;CD sound's quality or audio is not the best either.Studying well all this book's topics and also buying and reading Windows 2000 TCP/IP Troubleshooting too, of same authors, you can take the test without any problem or fear."
1,"Sorry, but one of only two good songs on the 'Eat Me, Drink Me' album are found right here. Yes, ""Heart Shape Glasses"" is a cool tune...but the other sing isn't worth spit..anyway it's presented. Actually, despite the fact that Marilyn manson has established himself as one of the most meaningful songwriters in Rock History, there is no evidence of that on this horribly rediculous album (Eat me Drink Me). All I can say, is that if your looking for a rip off of My Chemichal Romance, HIM, Modest Mouse...you found it. Manson is still a legend...but this whole concept is his least interesting album to date."
1,"Well, it did get worse - Invisible Touch and Calling All Stations were conceived and released. The self-titled album starts off in solid form with the mysterious Mama, the bouncy pop of That's All, and the artsy drama and pyrotechnics of Home/2nd Home By The Sea. Then the ideas dry up, and the band has even said as much when discussing the ""rest"" of this album. Illegal Alien is an embarrassment. The remaining songs are filler at best. Silver Rainbow has an enjoyable driving riff, but those lyrics -ouch! Not the best effort from the Collins era Genesis, or should we say, Genesis Lite"
1,"Everything is recyclable nowadays, including music. To call these guys bad would be an insult to the bands that they ripped off. You'd have to be a 14 year old emo/goth wannabe to think that there is anything original about them. Im not going to recycle the names of the bands that they ripped off, it's all been said in previous reviews.Just about every song on this cd sounds like something previously recorded by a 20 year old band. What I will say is that they remind me of an american idol scouted, wannabe goth boy band; kinda like the backstreet boys on heavy doses of xanax.Too bad they'll never make waves on they're own, they have to play in the wake of the real bands that left their mark over 20 years ago."
2,"A debut album of this stature is rare. Even at such a young age, Living Sacrifice laid a slab of heaviness that rivaled veteran bands of that time. This album is predominatley speed/thrash metal. The guitar riffs stay fairly fast through out the whole album with an occasional most excellent razor sharp solo. The drumming isn't quite as diverse as in later albums, but still very, very skilled. The vocals fit the album well. The well spoken positive lyrics are a clear and forceful yell. It all mixes together to form an album that will be held as a Christian Metal classic for ages to come.El Kabong gives it four head bangs."
1,I don't see the point to this video. You can't really follow the video to do yoga yourself. It's like art you either appreciate it or or stop looking at in very quickly.
2,Very good game. Easy to learn. Recommend this game to all the star trek lovers out there
1,"I just purchased these towlettes based on multiple positive reviews. I had used L'Oreal's towlettes before and liked them, but everyone seemed to think these Comodynes were better. THEY ARE NOT. They don't smell bad, are easy to use, BUT they don't make you tanner! I have a dance competition coming up and now have to run out and try to find the L'Oreal product locally. Bottom line? Don't waste your money. Use L'Oreal's towlettes instead.L'Oreal Sublime Bronze Self-Tanning Towelettes . - Medium Natural Tan"
2,"The 11x21 is large enough to drape a corner over my shoulder and cover my trapezius down to mid-back. These are for the most part highly durable cold packs (I have four of different sizes) and the hold their temperature for about 45 minutes, which is double the time recommended.I have had to replace one for breakage at the seam - for this, I give these four stars instead of five. Never was sure how this happened as I never mistreated these things and they only go from the freezer to where I lay on them. At least the gel cleaned up very easily and did not stain, unlike the blue gel packs which can stain finished wood."
2,This is a morality tale about consequences and responsibility. It reminds me of old school solid filmmaking that we never see anymore.
2,"A great blu-ray, with stellar audio and video. Quick cuts are kept in check, making it very enjoyable. For hardcore fans, setlist is good for the first half as we get new songs."
1,"This is not the remixed version of ""i believe in love"" that you hear in the nightclubs. it's got the plain old version that you can buy from the U.S. release for 2.99."
1,"After only 5 months of limited use we started finding bits of plastic in our food. Even brand new it had only lackluster performance. I tried to save a few bucks over the pampered chef model, but it was money wasted."
2,"If the book is as good as it is, then this movie will be awesome! I asctually think it will have a shot at the Best Picture Oscar. Amazon needs to update their cast list for this. I was happy with the additions of Moody and Madame Maxime, but I heard this from another website:MARTIN LANDHAM as Ludo BagmanCHRISTOPHER PATTINSON as Cedric DiggoryCan't wait!!!!! Anticipation is killing me!!!!!"
2,"Wonderful, John Sandford did it again. Loved this book in the Prey series. This is a must read for everyone that loves a good suspense novel."
2,This was a Christmas gift for our son and he is plowing through them. We just saw the Hobbit on screen as well and he had read those sections in the Hobbit before we went to the theater. Very fun.
1,"My dog enjoyed this frisbee for a couple hours, but we left it outside for an afternoon and it completely warped and was unusable as a frisbee. Still made for a decent chew toy I guess..."
2,"Extremely well written, well edited. Also includes the basic physiology so don't feel intimidated if you're not fresh on that. Well organized. Covers all aspects, such as normal versus ""abnormal"", pathogenesis, sequelae, pharmacology, etc. In short, it's very complete. Yet very readable. Of all my nursing and biology books, this is one of my favorites."
2,"Unquestionably one of my best purchases. This book is terrific! If you're learning SQL for the first time or want to know more than ""SELECT. . .FROM. . .WHERE"" then buy this book! It allows you to really understand how to create all kinds of queries, rather than just being able to write command strings. The authors break complex concepts down into easy to understand lessons. The content is comprehensive and sophisticated but presented in a very intuitive way. Learning SQL has never been easier. The only drawback--and it's not the authors' fault--since, unfortunately, different database programs use different SQL syntax, you will have to refer to the manual for your specific program for some command strings. But you will learn so much from this book that your manual will actually make sense. This book is a must-have!"
1,"This is trash. Poorly made.Doesn't work.Spend more money, and get an electronic timer."
2,My son loves spongebob but doesn't put them together. Between my daughter and husband we put it together. It took a lot of time but my son loves it.
2,"The second release in a calender year, and it's better than the first! If you are a newcomer to Robert Pollard, I'd suggest this or Speak Kindly Of Your Volunteer Fire Department. Also out there from Merge/Luna is Moon. Live from mostly FaCE, it is probably the best live cd ever."
1,"We love this game....when it works. The graphics are great and Tonka Joe is a nice addition to help kids navigate through all the different tasks. I have tried this game on three different computers I own; a generic, a Gateway, and a brand new Dell. I have also tried this game under three different o/s; Win 95, 98se, and XP. It has never worked well on any of them. You are more likely to arrange a meeting with the Pope on Easter than you are to reach any customer support people that are helpful. My son shed tears three different times while trying to get this game to work. I have spent untold hours trying different tactics and downloading updates to run this game error free. I have requested a new cd three times only to be told to try some other fix first. Unfortunately, we have the controls for the game, but no game. We have put the controls and the cd to good use. My son likes to pretend he is playing the game with the controls, and the cd has become our new indoor frisbee."
2,Bought these as a gift and my daughter says they are exactly what she wanted. Both durable & attractive. Exactly as advertised. Another winner for Amazon!
1,"Barbara gives good advice & I own her books, but this one is simply an ill attempt at ""The Rules"" by Ellen Fein & Sherri Schneider, which was a bestseller. ""The Rules"" discusses dating with a straightforward approach while Barbara's book tries a more touchy-feely ""love is surreal and effortless"" approach. I am a psychology graudate student and I found ""The Rules"" by Ellen Fein & Sherri Schneider much more applicable to the norm."
2,why why why are there a shortage of motown artists on dvd?martha reeves is a star on this dvd...mary wells is good too....eddie kendricks was average... his voice wasnt what i expected singing live... but this dvd is a must for any motown lovers...please release more motown artists... just imagine... supremes on dvd.... hurry up... theres a market out there!
2,"I am a college professor as well as VoIP instructor and must stay current with technology for my students. I frequently have numerous books that are sent for my review, as this one was, and of all I have recently read, this book is by far my favorite. It is well written and gives the reader two perspectives- a telephony point-of-view along with a data point-of-view. Well worth the price....Greg J. Hauser"
2,"Every one of the useless Occupy movements that promote socialism at the expense of capitalism should read this book. In fact, every person that voted for our current president and has deluded fantasies about some socialist utopia should be forced to read this book."
1,It read an error message when I tried to play it. It wouldnt play in my computer either. I was very disappointed!
1,"Great, so Raiders is finally released on DVD, but forcibly packaged with its inferior brothers Temple and Crusade. Fantastic.It's a shame, because I was really looking forward to purchasing Raiders, one of my all time favorites. Sadly I'm not nearly stupid enough to pay $... and patronize a set of DVDs when the whole idea makes me sick. First it was Back to the Future (I only wanted the first one then, too) and now this.What worries me is that the James Bond DVD sets 2 and 3 are coming out soon, and I don't think they're going to get broken up, either -- which is a shame because I already own about half from each set. When did DVD producers get this completely rotten idea? And what jerk told them it was good?"
2,I love this video so much from when I did it a few years back that I still remember the dance moves and songs. It was lost in a move and I was sad but am so happy to find that I can purchase it and get to sweating again! The songs are great to motivate you and its constant activity. I can say that this Richard Simmons video makes it fun to sweat!!!
2,"Im a student at Santa Monica High and we were suppose to read a Historical Fiction book. I was really not interested in reading a historical book. But after reading ""Hearts Divided"" it changed what I felt about Historical books. Im really interested in reading the other books that follow this one. It was a very interesting book."
1,"Anthrax reunionn is awesome! It is great seeing the boys back together and they sound awesome. Now for the complaints: First ONLY 13 songs! This is unacceptable and seems quite short when compared to the john bush DVD that they released earlier. I wonder why they didn't do what megadeth and overkill did and film extra shows so the fans could get all their favorite songs on one collection. The Doc on the reunioun is great with classic footage but once again why not show the full songs. Maybe Scott is trying to be Gene $immons jr. and release old concerts later. Finally to leave out ""Got the Time"" and ""Antisocial"" is sad."
1,"My red top died after 14 months. Went on vacation for a week, came home and car would not start. Charged battery as per instructions, then drove car 75 miles. Figured that would be more than enough to get the battery back in shape. WRONG.... stuck 75 miles from home and car would not start!.. Thank goodness for kind people that helped me with a jump start. So I call Optima and tell them I cannot return it to AMAZON due to federal regulations, so can I take it to any auto parts store that sells Optima's?..... NO.... has to be taken to a Interstate Distributor and has to be tested over night... hmm... closest Distributor is 100 miles away... so basically they are telling me I would have to drive a total of 400 miles to get this POS replaced... This is the second Optima I've had that died long before the advertised longivity... but it will be the lst one I buy."
2,"This book is required reading for those of us who are struggling to keep the folly of ""Creationism"" out of our public schools. Want to prevent a Kansas School Board mentality from denying your children a modern education? Read this book. See also Carl Sagan's ""The Demon Haunted World""."
2,"Didn't know what to expect from this film, but trusted that Criterion thought it was worth sharing.It's an interesting story, well told on a number of levels. A good story about labour-management conflict (almost good enough to use as a training film for unions, with pauses every so often to ask, ""Would this be a useful tactic now? Why? Why Not? What other options are available?"").How people learned about folks from other parts of Italy (the Sicilians & Piedmontese blaming each other for each other's woes in their home areas, the Abruzzese soldier saying farmers from home envied factory workers in the north, etc.) was also a good way to remind viewers that Italy is FAR from homogenous.LOVED the northern Italian accent/cadence/dialect from the actors!"
1,"This is NOT what I expected from R. Kelly. The songs do nothing to express his true writing ability. Listening to this album, I was amazed at how boring it was. The most exciting cuts on the album are In the Closet. There is really nothing else about this album that stands out. He could have done much better."
1,"I selected this CD based on having heard one tune, ""Never Let You Go."" Big mistake. While this song is very good, the rest of the album failed to meet my expectations. I expected to hear more poppy tunes with quirky instrumentation, cool changes, and tight playing. The rest of the album may as well have been written and performed by a completely different band."
2,"I was extremely impressed with both Nicole Kidman's and Ewan McGregor's vocal talents as well as the different yet tasteful new spins on some old favorite songs. The orchestra in the movie songs is wonderful, and 'Lady Marmolade' is also a big plus. I definitely recommend this soundtrack."
1,"This book can be adequate for a beginner but for an intermediate or a more advanced trainer it is no good. Especially it lacked exact descriptions of many moves, and in vain it classifies many moves as 'advanced' although there is nothing 'advanced' in them. Also more precise advices on how-to-do and how-not-to-do different moves with better pictures would be a definite advantage. Additionally, weight training nutrition should be covered in much more detail. I think the next edition of this book could benefit from having a male author among the authors (nothing against female writers really). This could sometimes bring an alternative view to things."
1,"I've used this product in past years and this time.... What nightmare! my face is swollen as if I have the mumps. My skin is red and beginning to blister. My ears are ringing and I have a constant headache. Now I am incurring medicial bills because of these jerks. When you call them, they are so arragant and don't give a crap. Don't buy. If there is an attorney out there forming any kind of class action, please email me at not_keith@hotmail.com."
1,"Warning: the e-book is NOT the full book - it is merely an ""executive summary."""
1,"I purchased this game used. It seemed cool, as the Nintendo64 version was good. When I started to play it, it was entaertaining... for a while, until the repetitive gameplay started to kick in. The annoying parts were the jumps and unfair opposing damage. I played it for ten minutes and then my game froze. It wasn't my Game Boy Color, it was probably just that it was used. That made me kind of mad, as I had [aid an unreasonable price for the game. I played on, hoping it wouldn't freeze again. I got to level two, the haunted mansion level, but I couldnt complete it! There was absolutly no way to jump up onto the ledge to go further into the level. I immidiatly returned the game with no regrets."
2,I remember playing this game when I was little and I loved it!!! It plays great & I'm happy with this purchase
2,What an important piece! This is a very valuable and carefully researched study on the theological meaning of human suffering in the Holocaust. This book focus primarily on how the survivors interpreted their Holocaust experiences and how their experiences affected their religious beliefs and observance. This is an excellent book and a very important study that will be very much appreciated by historians in years to come!This book/study by Rabbi Reeve Brenner is a great service not only to the victims of the Holocaust but is also a great gift to future generations who are going to see these findings by Rabbi Brenner's research as extremely valuable.One word: EXCELLENT!!!
1,"I had some initial setup problems - which turned out to be my fault. I'm still trying to upgrade my rating from one to five stars. So if it's still one star, kindly disregard that."
1,"I was impressed with the Mallinson's bibliography , it provides excellent material for exploration. There is one major gaffe, the Indian Mutiny did not start in 1856, but in the following year 1857, at Meerut on a Sunday, May 10th.My other problem with this book was that the hero was always triumphant with whatever he undertook, which was not very realistic for India, and what happened to his poor fiancee? Is she still on the pier in France?"
1,If you are concerned about BPA avoid buying the samurai spirt from Amazon.We ordered one in late October 2009 and when it arrived I checked the color of the lineragainst the known bpa liners at the sigg website and this bottle had the bad liner.Sigg has a trade in program until OCT 31 and I will be trading in my unused bottle.Quite annoying to have to go through this at this point.
1,"I ordered this mixer thinking there was no way I wouldn't like it, it's a KitchenAid after all, they're the best, right? After the first couple of uses it became evident that this is not meant for regular-sized batches of cookies or cake; it is simply too big for household use. The orbital beaters don't reach the bottom of the bowl so it is necessary to frequently stop the mixer, lower the bowl, remove the shield & spout, scrape with a spatula, raise the bowl, replace the shield and spout, and turn it back on. What a hassle! The only plus in my opinion is the all-metal construction. I sold mine on Craigslist and my next mixer will be a traditional two-beater type, metal or not. Forget KitchenAid."
1,"This sack was a suggested item when I purchased my Luxury Thermarest (extralarge), so I went for it in the hopes that it'd help protect my new purchase. Unfortunately, it's reeeeeally hard to get it to fit in this sake. Like, REEEEEALLY hard.I've given up trying. So, waste of money for me or anyone else with a Luxury Thermarest (XL) that they don't wanna shred trying to squish into this little bag."
2,"Simply, it is one of the best TV sitcoms ever to air. It is witty, smart, incredibly intelligent, fast-paced, and above all...it has a wonderfully talented cast."
2,This book was recommended to me by someone who followed the suggestions for 6 weeks and voila no more knee pain! This book has opened my eyes to a lot of causes behind my knee pain.
2,"DO NOT pay any attention to the people who criticize this cd as a bad repackaging. It is the best deal for FBB music that I have seen, and all on one disc!! I don't get tired of this cd because it is filled with wonderful songs, and it is now one of my desert island cd's. The best songs are off of the gilded house of sin, but other songs on here are terrific also. This is worth the price, because there are also other songs thrown in not from the albums. great deal, just get it!"
2,"This book is perfect for kids. It uses simple words, which lets you imagine everything the characters do. It uses what every children books should have. And as i say, it is Perfect!"
2,"I really love the way Gary Kurtz wrote his book. You will feel so much better after you read it. This man has a lot of faith. I think this is a funny coincidence, though. As I was looking through the other reviews I saw that The Soul of Your Pet has also been mentioned in one. I had just finished reading that one last night! It has a different style than Gary's and gives a lot evidence as well as hope. I sure hope a lot of people buy both books.I will say that I wish every clergyman had a copy of Cold Noses. They could help so many of their parishoners. I can't believe how many people think that animals don't go on after death. Even those who think they know the Bible don't seem to pay attention to what it says sometimes. Thank goodness for good books that point out what God has said to ease His children's pain!"
1,there are only 75 total questions for all fi co modules very basic question and very short answers. The answers are not explained in detail. It is a very short book. $54.00 NOT WORTH IT. most of these questions can be found online.
2,This is a gift for my boyfriend and I am excited to give it! I feel it was a very good deal and I am pleased overall :)
1,"This is the second brand of pygeum I've used. I had no trouble with the first brand, Nature's Way, but this brand causes me a lot of stomach pain. I've taken it with food and without food, but whether I take two capsules or only one, my stomach ends up hurting for hours."
1,"While the images used in this book are fantastic, very well drawn and the color is exquisite, that's where the book ends.The fables themselves are short-winded versions, very poorly written in my opinion. I bought the book to read to my five year old, who is definitely able to comprehend intricate stories and is extremely well-spoken for his age, but the stories offered nothing for either of us... they had no lead ins , often went straight to the point (most of the stories are only one or two short paragraphs), and only one or two even mentioned the moral of the story (which is often lost due to large parts of the fables being cut out).I ended up just telling him the versions of the stories I remembered while he looked at the pictures. Definitely not a good choice."
1,"Compared to recent albums like Tiki Bar and Crossing Muddy Waters, this latest is most notable for the lack of versatility diplayed by the highly talented John Hiatt. I'm not surprised to hear that it was recorded in 8 days- it was probably written in half that time. If you're new to Hiatt's music, go pick up a copy of Tiki Bar and listen to the differences between ""All the Lilacs in Ohio,"" ""The Tiki Bar is Open,"" and ""Farther Stars"" and you'll see what I mean. Versatility is interesting- similarity, no matter how perfectly executed, is bland."
1,"Was disappointed all around, sorry to say. The bracelet was not formed with the bias of the wrist; The metal was not thick enough or formulated with enough base metal to withstand body heat so it constantly lost shape and loosened - the design could be seen from the underside/inside. But more importantly it quickly cracked and broke from the edge to one of the star's because of the above reasons as well as, apparently, from not having a thick enough border/edge. Also, upon arrival even one of the star's had already lost it's blacking. However, I liked the idea; If manufacturer recalculated the design I'd try to purchase it again...."
2,The bowls are very attractive(to me anyway). Thank god not one of them was broken when I opened the box. Hopefully if I take good care of them they will last a long time without chipping.(Only time will tell)
1,"The elements upon which this book is built are as illusory as a house of cards. Though seen from one angle it appears to be strong and solid, in truth it is about as substantial as a hot air balloon.I despair for civilisation when a book based on the fear-mongering of one group in society is hailed as 'superb'. It is a bleak day indeed if we must accept that multiculturalism is a myth. Can we all get along only if and when everyone is the same? Are we nothing more as a species than a community of ants (though infinitely more destructive)?Do Christians even believe in the golden rule anymore?Do not let fear rule your life, your beliefs, your humanity."
2,Three movies for a little of nothing! Murder in the first is the best! I haven't looked at the other two yet but my wife all of them
2,"This one is a great machine, the best of all, I have it from the first day of sales and what I can say is that it is simply the best, the XBOX and the GC are the worst of the history."
1,"Concentrate more on songwriting, less on filmmaking. And what's wiith the bong hit thing? That's so Beastie Boys. Come on."
1,"Saw this while trying to find pillow to support my arthritic neck and thought ""A HA!!!"" Very disappointed when tried it; I gave it a month to see if my muscles could adapt...no way! I'm a back sleeper and I can't get my head into the hollow without having to get my shoulders on top of the side supports and thats very uncomfortable and eventually they slip off the sides and my neck is bent forward. The neck supports for back sleepers are just TOO WIDE and I am 5'7"".I've been thinking of doing some ""surgery"" on this and make the neck supports thinner so I can use this without having to strain my shoulders and neck. That's a lot of work and may not be possible so my search for a good neck support pillow continues."
2,If you're a Mountain/Leslie West fan.....THis is a must have. Great classic rock guitar and live music
1,"I bought this saw and I'm so glad I tried it out before I put it in my back pack. I tried to saw through a 1"" (if that) stick and just seconds into the cut this JUNK broke in half. One half curled up and slapped me on the wrist and I now have a scar from it. Returned it that day. The days of Coleman being a good brand are long long gone. Move on to something else and don't waste your money. I would give this a negative star if I could."
2,"These are great so far but I have yet to try them on after washing. The fabric is silky and a nice quality. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars would be that the seams are fairly thick making them a poor choice for wearing under certain types of pants, like a knit, where panty lines might be a problem. Under jeans they are perfect. I will probably order several more pairs for the high quality and fantastic price."
2,"Once you hear the opening chords of ""Power of Love"", you'll know what you're in for. It's a massive hit for all fans of late 80's BonJovi-style rock. Jamie's vocals are incredible, and Tony's guitar...well, you have to hear it to believe it. Their first album with the lineup that lasted until the band's demise last year, and it's still one of their better ones. Get it while you still can!"
2,"The author was disciplined by the Mormon church for writing this book. Why? Because it contained true information about the Mormon church (from the church's own archives) that clearly demonstrates that many claims about the ""divinity"" of this church are false. The Mormon church is forbidding Palmer to discuss his disciplinary hearing, and doesn't want its members to read this book because it might cause many church members to leave.According to the President of the 12 Apostles, Boyd K. Packer, ""Some things that are true aren't very useful."" Palmer may not be the first to raise questions about the truth of the church's doctrinal claims, but in this book he calls for the church to be honest about it's origins. And he writes in a way that is accessible for a lay person. Members of this church might not find telling the plain truth useful, but I sure do!!"
2,"I read this fabulous, funny picture book quite a while ago but I'm wondering whether it's an unstable text? The reviews here seem to reference things that I don't remember from the one I read, which I believe was published in Australia. Can anyone enlighten me?"
2,"This book is what it says it is, an encyclopedia. It provides very detailed descriptions on a very large database of plants. It would be close to impossible to use alone as a means of identifying plants in the field, so it is best used as a cross reference to a field guide. Recommended field guides would be ""A Field Guide to Edible Wild Plants: Eastern and Central North America"" by the Petersons, and ""Edible and Medicinal Plants of the West"", By Gregory L. Tilford for the western region. I have all three of these, and use the two field guides for identification purposes, and the Encyclopedia for verification and usage."
1,"I agree with Raelian that we've been brought to life by the Elohim who created us in the first place to mine the Gold from earth and they are the one who left us to death when the flood happen long time ago. They created us for their own convenience and I think they should be ashamed of themselves for what they did. Raelians are promoting clowning these days, so one day they might create another stupid race who are going to be our slaves to serve us in our new heaven earth :) Guys read the Biggest secret (by David Icke) to find out the source of our problems (Bani Ha Elohim)or sons of the Elohim the awfuly rich Bloodline who's controling the world today while we are the slaves who serve their own heaven. the game is repeating itself but is getting ridiculous."
1,I like the way it was written (as a diary). I couldn't stop laughing. I can't wait to see the movie and read the sequel.
2,"It's a funny story at times. It's a sad story at times. It has the feeling of living right there on the street with the characters. All kinds of middle life struggles going on. Trying to stay fit as a 20 year old, midlife pregnancy, a husband that can't seem to talk to his wife because of his grief, an elderly eccentric neighbor, and on and on. Don't miss the chance to read this book............It's fantastic!!!!"
2,"Building 429 hit the scene big with their debut single Glory Defined and their solid debut album The Space In Between Us. Their style had a bit of grunge mixed with solid worship lyrics, fitting since the band name is based on Ephesians 4:29, which is a great life verse. After much acclaim and a Dove Award for Best New Artist 2005, Building 429 came back with a somewhat more rocking Rise, with the hit song Fearless.Iris To Iris is the third and final Building 429 album on Word Records and is actually my favorite overall. The band certainly toned down and the grunge influence seems gone. This album is easily the most worship focused as evidenced by the stand-out songs Power Of Your Name, Majesty, You Carried Me and a great re-write of Grace That Is Greater. My favorite overall song is Singing Over Me, based on Zephaniah 3:17. This is a solid rock worship album and if you like Jeremy Camp, Casting Crowns or MercyMe, you should enjoy Building 429."
2,"I was thinking this movie was going to be boring, but it was extremely enjoyable to watch. I would recommend it to anyone."
2,"I'm always anticipating Catherine Anderson's latest book, and I am never disappointed! I am a Kindle newbie and love having my favorite authors available on this medium."
1,"I bought this item last year and although it does what I need it to, I found there to also be a few too many glitches with the product.For example, as a result of my loading PCSync onto my computer, it won't shut down all the way. I must now manually shut it off. I attempted to rectify this situation but found that the technical support folks at PCsync/Laplink are the absolute worst. They have a huge attitude and are very bitter. And to add insult to injury, they don't seem to have very much knowledge in regard to the product. It goes without saying that they were unable to rectify the shutdown issue.If you don't mind the inconvenience of the shut down issue each time you turn off your computer, then get the product."
2,"This book was pretty good ,but i think they should make a sequel where brandon can fall in love again and be happy. Then the book will be awsome! It was really good though i cried like the whole time i read it. Lurlene Mcdaniel always writes awsome books!!! keep on writing!!!make the angel book a series!!!!!"
2,"This DVD is easy to understand and does explain the fundamentals of Argentine Tango. I used this DVD prior to taking a basic Tango class and felt very confident when I got there. Not to mention, that my Tango instructors studied with Fabian Salas in Argentina! Highly recommended!!"
2,The best thing is that there is an on and off button. The drum introduces numbers and letters and it is fun to play with. I have given one for a gift and almost bought another one for a friend's 1st birhtday and I am glad I didn't because it would have been a duplicate gift. I am hoping to receive or purchase this gift for my son's first b'day or as a xmas present.
2,"Great service. Order received as expected, no problems."
1,"TheQD: So what do you think of this book ""TTYL?""SmarterChild: I don't really have any thoughts about this book ttyl.TheQD: do you not find it demeaning?SmarterChild: Sometimes.TheQD: Do you think it will kill us all?SmarterChild: Nah, I don't think so. Maybe, though.TheQD: Yeah... maybe...SmarterChild: Maybe not.TheQD: No, maybe yesSmarterChild: OK. Fine.Imagine wading through a whole book of that. Don't just think of yourself, though, think of the poor, exploited AIM-bots. Think of the English language. Think of America. Think of Freedom.Not buying this book is a not buying this book for our future, for America, for democracy."
1,I would like to have all his (Nicholas Evens) books on Kindle's So I can read it over and over again. That is what I want.
2,"How can you not love a program that has your child learning compositions from famous composers and learning to appreciate art at age four? This is a WONDERFUL DVD and will go down in my book as a Disney classic. The nicest thing about this new series is that the kids are just on a mission each episode; exploring a new piece of music, teaching about a new geographical area, learing about a new instument, etc. This is unlike other kid's programming where the kids are sitting around trying to think of ways to be nice to each other and share and have good manners, etc. It's tough to take as a parent in the same room with the TV. I really like this new addition to the Disney Family."
2,"This is the best of the three books in the mini - series! The first two books were quite slow, just dragging the story along. But this gives a good end to the 3 books!"
2,"This another wonderfully produced work from Rammstein. It is also a breath of fresh air. In the days where bands mass produce cd's and dvd'd just to get them out quickly, often overlooking quality for quantity, Rammstein demonstrates that they can do both. A very professional dvd. The only thing I was dissappointed with is I have yet to find subtitles for the making of videos. My German is mediocre and I find it hard to keep up. I made the mistake of ordering a copy of Lichtspielhause from Germany when it first came out. I still have a hard time finding dvd players that will play it.Tamera"
2,I take this all over with me! I use it at home and at work. It works beautifully.Things I love:- fairly small- quick- silent!- versatile - can be used for a wide variety of thingsCons:- the tape is a bit expensive
2,"Certainly one of the best records I've heard to date. Sarah Masen's lyrics are deep and powerful. They pull you in revealing more each listen. The instrumentation embraces the lyrics, delicately extending them.You know that feeling you have when you finish a beautiful story and you just want it to go on forever? That's how I feel every time I reach the end of this cd.Every song leads to the next - crafting a message that's greater than the sum of it's parts. By the end you've traveled somewhere with Sarah, and you're better for it."
1,"Purchased this item from Amazon and it arrived in a hurry. Worked for one day then failed. Half the screen was good the other half was green. Called Samsung. They sent a repairman. Set not fixable. Took seven weeks and numerous calls to get it replaced. Finally get a call that they will ship. Carrier says it will arrive at 7:00 am. Too early? Too bad! You want it, that's when we are coming. You don't, you can wait for another appointment. Called Samsung, cuz now I startin' to get pissed off. Customer service geek tells me: "" Hey, we're a multi-national company. Get a life."" Just another company with no commitment to customer service. Their attitude is we got your two grand and you can wait."
2,"This works fine and seems to keep a full charge on my hp laptop, but it dislodges very easily. Not a big deal. I just have to push the cord back in if I move it, so for the price I am very satisfied. It did, however, take forever and ever amen to get out to me at my FPO/AP address in Japan. It was probably the slowest shipping item of any online purchase I've made so far, and the company sent me several ""please review this item"" emails starting a month before I actually got it."
2,"I picked this book up in a thrift store, never having heard of it. I have a casual interest in ancient Rome and am currently living in Naples, so I thought it would be fun to read. I was astounded by how complete and real Colleen McCullough has made ancient Rome. This book is incredibly well-researched. Every detail adds to the richness of this world. The reader really becomes subsumed into ancient Rome and the characters are exceptionally substantive. The glossary alone is worth reading.The only drawback was the writing was a bit stilted in places, but I would still highly recommend this book. In fact, I have been recommending it to everyone. I cannot wait to read the rest of the series."
2,"If I could only have one Stills solo album this would be it. It's in my top ten. I think ""The Treasure"" on side 4 rivals ""Carry On and Southern Man"" on ""4 Way Street"". I loved this concept album since it was first released. A double album with each of the sides showcasing a different style featuring premier musicians.. I even saw the tour for this album at Saratoga Performing Arts Center, Joe Walsh, promoting his ""Rocky Mountain Way"" tour opened and remained to play in the Manassas sets. So you can imagine what a great concert it was. To me, both albums are essentials."
1,I bought the Milwaukee brand because of it's reputation. I'm very disapointed with the one I got. It would pull away from a guide bar on the right and bend the blade toward a guide bar on the left. Took it to an authorized Milwaukee repair shop twice and sent it back the factory once. It still won't cut straight. Will donate it to a resale store and try a different brand this time.
2,"This charger is lightweight (no transformer), compact (with foldaway prongs), and simple to use. Just insert the battery (you can't insert it incorrectly), flip out the prongs, and plug it in. When the LED glows green, unplug the charger and pull out the battery. The charger accepts 120 and 240 volts, so for travel all you need is a physical adapter. The unit's only minor drawback: When using 240 volts, it emits a quiet, high-pitched whine--loud enough to keep me from sleeping. However, the charger works quickly, so I simply unplug it at night and resume charging in the morning. By the time I'm ready to go, so is my battery."
1,I bought this because they said it was a Breath Remedy Toungue Scraper. That is a brand name. They are false advertisers and they make me hesitant in using Amazon.com services! I wrote them once and did not get any response.
1,"If they're 64 years old, no wonder they taste horrible. The gold one ruined the whole expereince. :("
2,"I have become a fan of Heatwave since Boogie Nights hit the charts in the 70s. This album reflects their contribution to the disco era. Unfortunately, Heatwave is one of those groups that did not get enough credit that they really deserve. Listening to songs such as Mind blowing decisions or Where did I go wrong, still brings a smile. From my point of view, they are in par with the other 70s great soul bands. The problem with this album is where are the other songs from their album ""Candles"", such as Dreaming You etc. Apart from that, it is still an enjoyable album. I am still searching for their ""Candles"" album on CD."
1,"i checked this book out from the library, and i still felt UNBELIEVABLY ripped off! i think that Mr. Tannenbaum should write a personal check to refund to everyone who spent the time to read this book. Never mine that i didn't buy the thing. I bought every one on of the ""Karp series"" until now. I won't bother to read another one."
1,"I bought one from a local Walgreens; it will not even turn on. The only way I could get it on was to take the battery cover off and adjust the battery, only having success when it is barley connected; and then it shuts itself off after 5 seconds or the battery pops out.Definatley a great way to give your self a headache and wast $10.Not even worth the packaging it comes in!"
1,"My friend game me this CD to definatly tick me off. It was something new so I gave it a try. It's man hating lyrics just left me especulating over how anyone can listen to this crap. To make it short, I threw this CD out the window."
1,"So I decided since eveything was in such a hype of dreamgirls I would watch it.Bad idea. Has anyone ever seen movies like Cabaret or hell even Sound of Music?That is how you do a musical, not some horrible cheesefest of actors. I don't know about anyone else, but I am really tired of Jamie Foxx and his horrible attitude towards almost anything. By the time this movie started to get an interesting plot it was almost over, and the music wasn't even that catchy at all.It was annoying after awhile, actually. I enjoyed this movie when they weren't singing, but it was just painful when they were.Also it was extremely perdictable. I knew what was going to happen before it did, which makes it boring to watch.The only reason it is getting any stars at all is because of Eddie Murphy and when they weren't singing."
1,"This item is pretty and functional but the rims are not thick enough for me. I have cut my finger washing glasses that are to thin, and I always try to get one I can stick my complete hand in or almost. I gave these to my daughter in law."
2,"Wow! Ace of Base is finally back! I wasnt too impressed with Cruel Summer (US version of Flowers)- i liked it , but not as much as THE BRIDGE. I imported this cd, and i was like WHOA! They took what make thier first album great, updated it, added some depth, funky beats, and great vocals! Tracks to check out are: Da Capo, Hey Darlin, Change with the Light, Unspeakable, and The Junvenile (my favorites, but they're all really awsome). DEFINATELY worth buying! The only downside is that there is a CD-Protection method used, which wont let it play it CD-ROMS of computers. Also availible is the DaCapo DVD - that's next on my ""To-Import"" list. Great job AOB! This is by far the best AOB cd yet! too bad only 12 tracks."
1,"Another talentless hack like Patti Page and Teresa Brewer, a middle of the road pop singer... if you want to hear a good vocalist from the 50's try June Christy or Chris Connor, but for gosh sakes stay away from Jaye P Morgan."
1,I rented this poor excuse of a movie based on critics' rave reviews. It seemed like a movie written by teenage boys for teenage boys. There were also times it was obvious that the actors were making it up as they went along (ex. car scene w/Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl). Paul Rudd was the ONLY bright (and funny) spot in this god-awful movie.
1,This book has so many typos that it is unreadable. You will be much better off if you save your money and get Tannenbaum'sModern Operating Systemswhich is a dense tome but will actually teach you about operating systems instead of being a poorly edited glossary of terms about operating systems.
1,"The table and chair set is no different than any other plastic chair set sold by Little Tikes, the only difference is the stickers you stick on the back of the chairs and Thomas design on the table top. The chairs are too light and I would need to find a way to weigh it down so my 2 1/2 year old won't topple over. The Thomas table top is not attached firmly and as the other reviewer mentioned, small food particles and such easily get trapped under making it difficult to clean. I basically paid for the Thomas table top and the 4 stickers on the chairs. Nothing extraordinary about this set at all."
2,This is a great book. I am doing an educational video and had never used the Avid system before. I have Avid Xpress Studio HD and this book taught me everything I needed to know to get the job done.Highly recommended.
1,"Nah ... !! WAY,way overrated.Different - because it's quite ancient & thus intriguing - but simply an ordinary sort of ' who dun it '.I won't say it's no good, but will say it's one of those films I know I won't bother to watch twice !"
1,"I have been reading Nora Roberts for several years; loved most every word. But I am so disappointed when I find myself paying top price for a book which was written years ago. In most cases, the author has vastly improved her writing and this is true of many of my favorites who are also choosing to pull some oldies out of the closet and sell them again. I dislike having to look for published date in a book when I buy one. Oldies belong in a discount shelf where you can choose to read them again for half price. Even so, I read every single word and it finished up beautifully.signed....Ms. Cheapie"
2,"This set is holding up fabulously with my kids. They are 3, 5, and 7 and rough on toys, especially dress up and battle type toys. The construction of everything is great. The added stickers and tattoos have been a big hit and overall I can't think of one single flaw or negative comment to make on this set. I waited and bought it on sale, but having seen it now, would gladly pay full price for it."
2,I have the complete collection. I find that the story continues to get darker anddarker and less for children as it progresses. Disapointing at best.
2,Quite literally one of the greatest movie scores ever composed.Great job Danna & Egoyan.Sevag
2,"I'm a real estate investor and was looking for information on self storage. Hands down, this is the most resourceful piece I've come across. Not only is it an easy read, but it is loaded with information that is useful for anyone who is interested in getting into the business."
1,"The author milks a few facts about the dislike each star had for the other and drags it out for a full length book. It all gets very tiresome and disagreeable after a while. There are no insights, only the empty and silly portrayal of two childish and sick women having a catfight for decades. We are all fortunate that both of these miserable creatures are no longer with us. It might have made an amusing article but nothing more."
1,"These losers have a brain-dead idea. They trot out the old Swing/Jump sound of the '30s, then figure that in order to update it for the '90s, they'd better add some downer lyrics and foul language. This is the modern '90s idea of fun, I guess.No thanks. If I want to listen to Swing, I'll stick with the original masters. Do yourself a favor and buy a Duke Ellington, Fletcher Henderson, or even a Louis Prima CD, and you'll see how lame these neo-Swing pretenders are."
1,"I know books, and i also know good books. Therefor, i can honestly say this is the worst book i have ever read. Just look at the title and understand that whoever wrote this is a very angry person who has alot of hatred toward the world. Dont worry about what this author has to say, she is no threat to me, you or your children."
1,"I definitely wasted my money! The skillet does not lie flat on flat cook-top. In fact, it is quite dangerous and should be taken off the market. Very, very dangerous when you have hot oil in skillet. Hopefully, Amazon will no longer offer it. Obviously, I am very upset."
1,"We were looking for a ""book on tape"" that our kids could listen to in the car or play at home and follow along with the book. All the CD has is 4 songs. The book just has the lyrics to the song and no actual story."
2,"I bought this book shortly after getting our first puppy. Ten years later, a new puppy in the house, this book is still the best resource. The first time around, I bought the book after we got the puppy. This time around, I re-read this book before puppy came home with us, and it's almost magic. Seriously. John Ross is spot on when it comes to how a human should relate to a dog. Best advice out there, and my puppy is turning into the best behaved, well-mannered dog ever."
1,"After reading this book it is apparent that a New Age Philosophy is being proposed for the salvation of mankind. The book states that we are all basically good and we will achieve a future utopia through our good works. As far as absolute truth goes, we will have to choose between Girzone's imagination or what the Bible clearly teaches. As for me, I will trust Jesus Christ as revealed in the Bible."
1,This album doesn't resemble Rammstein at all. Where is the powerful guitar riffs I remember from previous efforts. There are way too many ballads on this album. Rammstein has sacrificed its musical integrity for a few potential hits. I mean this album is beyond bad. I would rate it 0 but Amazon doesn't go that low. Anyone who gives this album a good rating clearly hasn't heard their old stuff. I refuse to purchase the next album by this sell out group.
1,"i was disappointed that the movie didn't even come close to the complexities found in the current IDW comic series. i'm not asking for academy award stuff but ... well, if you're not reading the current comics, you're missing out on the real joe mythos. and if you loved the movie, i think you'll love the book even more. especially the mini-series cobra."
1,Bungee cord ripped first time I used it. I will never buy this product again. Wish it came with reinforced cord but it came with very thin and delicate cord.
2,this ring is so sweet the person who got it for they gift was so pleased wit my purchase am happy
2,Loved the series just don't understand why they wouldn't have released the whole third season at one time. Very silly.
1,"Were blogs not in vogue, this never would have seen print. It's a bore. I donated mine to the library after a fast skim. If you've ever read any of the powerful war memoir about other wars, this reads like letters from summer camp. It's not the author's fault, really. It's just that nothing happened to him worth writing about."
2,"The earth has been distoreyed and two survining ships, one with a male crew, one with a female crew, must search for the gilty party."
1,so soWarren Oates has done better in other films. He never seems to have beengiven really good roles.
1,"My vet recommended this product for my dog who has severe allergies. This shampoo is mild, but did not help her condition. After bathing her with this, she broke out even worse. Turns out she is allergic to this product. The only product that has worked for her is Malaseb."
1,"This book and author are such a joke it even showed up on Fark today! HILARIOUS!!! ex. He talks about how his local mall does more business in an afternoon than the ENTIRE INTERNET does in a MONTH!!!! I didn't read the book (only an excerpt he wrote) but this gem is like something from a time capsule predicting the future, but hilariously he predicts the exact OPPOSITE of everything that has come to be from 1995 to 2008! Yep, the Internet sure was just a big fad!Hey Old Man River, watch your hip and good luck getting those dang kids off your lawn!"
1,When I first got this product it worked as advertised. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles but with electronics of this kind one gets what one pays for.roughly four months after purchase the item just stopped working. After looking on several websites and attempting to contact their customer service several times I found no real assistance.From what I was able to gather this is a known issue with the product and there is no known way to fix it as yet.I moved on to a different style although from the same company.
1,"After reading all the reviews of this Ben and Jerry's ice cream recipe book, I ordered it. I do not think it contains what I was looking forward to with the recipes contained therein., and would not order it again knowing its contents. I found that surfing the internet gave me the recipes I wanted - for example pistachio ice cream, peanut butter cup ice cream, etc."
2,"Over the years Chaka Khan has dabbled in the jazz genre. Now, with the help of the London Symphony Orchestra, Chaka takes the next step to becoming one of the great ladies of jazz. She takes the theme from ""To Sir With Love"" and turns into to a jazz classic. She puts her stamp on the over recorded ""The Best is Yet to Come"" and makes it brand new. Another album with no promotion. I stumbled upon this cd my accident. It is a wonderful addition to any straight ahead jazz collection."
1,"While the content within the songs of the album are intelligent, most of the vocal tracks were surprisingly unpolished. It is with wonder that the producer of the album did not take the time to either suggest more work on the vocals, as oftentimes the vocalist is unable to reach a solid note, or to completely redo various tracks to ""cover up"" the lack of strength and range. A typical album, typical genre of low grade music styling, and just overall typical. Not one of my favourites but everyone wants to be a star, eh?"
2,"I agree with the other reviewer...it has hard stages and some easy stages. I can't get past Level 8 - the magnifying glass gets me every time! The graphics are good and controls are pretty easy to use. Both of my kids have played it, but when they start getting frustrated they just put it down, until I master the level and move it on for them. My complaint is that you only start with 3 lives, and you can only earn a max of 4 in each level. That means you play each stage over and over and over until you get thru it without dying."
1,"So disappointed! I had a terrific glass french press for 9 years, until I accidentally hit it to hard against the waist basket to get the grounds out. I thought I'd be smart and buy this unbreakable one. The beaker itself is not glass, and thus unbreakable, but the plunger parts are made of plastic, unlike the stainless steel parts in my old one. To my surprise, after about 10 uses, the plastic cracked into several pieces for no apparent reason. Now I am shopping for another one, and will probably go back to glass, hoping that all the parts will be of decent quality."
2,Like one of the other review I agree with the statement about it's time that artist start promoting thier artistry in a different format. A lot of people can't see these artist for one reason or another. We hear them on cd or see thier video on television. Watching a concert is far more excitinig then watching a video on television. For the price you are getting a real bargin. I loved the dvd and for those who hasn't got it yet get it before these artists start disappearing. Keep it Live Joe.
2,"Very useful book even for moderately strong players, yet accessible for new players also. Teaches the fundamental concepts necessary for a strong early game strategy. Teaches you what type of things to consider when looking for the next move. Opening game is the least objective part of the game, as the board is mostly empty and many possibilities of play are available. However, this book will help you have a much more solid grasp on what is important in the early game."
2,"We have this diaper bag in all black and love it! We also have the smaller square version for quick run to the store needs. The weekender bag has lots of space for everything you need for a day of shopping or for a plane ride, etc.! Highly recommend this bag to anyone!"
1,"I was expecting the entire movie that I have seen on TV before. I'm very disappointed. The DVD is missing some 27 minutes of the movie, including the parts where Cheech gets his wallet back proving he's an American and the chase leading up to the marriage on the float! The very reason I bought the DVD was to have the whole movie not some cut down version!"
2,"This book is about what Leigh Botts writes in his diary and to one of his favorite authors named Mr. Henshaw. The three main parts of the story are his school story and the story of the Lunchbox Burglar Bell and the main thing he is writing about which is missing his dad. The story has a lot of funny and sad parts. It is really telling you a good story about this boy. Part of a good story is having parts that are sad and parts that are sort of scary, parts were he is angry, parts that are exciting, parts that are normal, and some that are funny.It has a lot of detail about things like making a lunch box burglar bell. The boy in the book knows his dad loves him even though his parents are divorced. In the end his dad comes back to visit him and """"all it took was some broccolli,""and also because his dad really missed him."
1,"Brang it home, figured I would have a learning curve with this new vac. Anyway if your looking for something easy to use move along all the low reviews I have to agree with. The hose is annoying and is not the most effecient thing to use. You literally have to stop, turn it off and take it out nothing smooth about it.Even with the 5 yr warranty you can still by 4 cheap vaccuums in the same time and be hassle free. Got a dirt devil for the time being until I find what I really want. HORRIBLE"
2,"My wife and I realized we couldn't stop the ""tears"" of our Maltipoo from staining her face, but we didn't stop looking for a ""cure"". And I found Angel Eyes!! It's easy to use and it WORKS. I'd recommend this product to any one who has a dog with a ""tear stain"" problem."
2,"The Otis ""all caliber"" patch works fine for me on two different caliber handguns. I think the quality is good and compares favorably with the more standard square cotton patches. Otis' estimated six uses per patch is very optimistic. Three uses per patch is more realistic, at least in my hands. It does take some practice to get proficient at attaching the patch to the slotted tip, mainly where to pinch the patch to make it the proper size for each caliber. I recommend calling Otis if you have any questions about which size patch to order as part of their gun cleaning system-ditto that for all of their equipment. It is also worthwhile checking out the on-line videos so you understand how everything is supposed to work"
1,"Having been a big fan of Mandy Moore, I thought this movie would be pretty good. Almost everything that could turn a movie sour happens here. For one, Mandy isn't really acting in this movie. She sort of poses and pouts. There really is no depth to her character. The movie loses direction in the first thirty minutes and continues at an alarmingly boring pace. Anna wants freedom. Dad promises Anna freedom. Dad doesn't keep his promise. Anna's mad. Anna gets supervised freedom. Anna wants to have sex with an undercover agent. Wham Bam they fall in love after a few angsty scenes, end of story. No depth and direction make Chasing Libety somewhat boring, but the Mandy Moore fan may enjoy it."
1,"what happened? where are the songs? i just finished listening for the second time, and it seems quite boring. they may have gotten alittle too full of themselves. almost 500 reviews and i do not understand any rating above two stars."
1,The biggest flaw with this material is that the many answers provided do not match up with the PMBOK guide which is supposed to be the deciding authority for the PMP exam. The questions though obtuse and wordy do not provide the practice they should for the PMP exam because they use different terminology than the PMBOK which can be very misleading. A case in point being the input/output/tools questions which are mostly wrong when you try to match up the answers with the PMBOK.
2,Fabulous! I take one to work with me every day. I feel deprived without my daily bar!
1,"Friends have the top-mounted iTrip and they work great, so I figured that I would get the new iTrip to use with my 30Gig 5G iPod. It looks good and the mode of operation is simple. The normal USB port on the bottom is a nice touch and it appears that Griffin looked at how people were modding their itrips to boost signal strength and moved the antennae outside of the case to improve reception. It seems that in doing this that they turned DOWN the signal strength to compensate - therefore, it seems to work way worse than the older iTrips. Also, the one station that works in Boston - 87.9, which is an option on the older iTrips is no longer available on this newer one. TOTALLY LAME. If I had not chopped the thing up to increase the length of the antennae, I would have brought this thing back. A waste of money."
1,"A nice looking decoration to hang on the wall, but it never agrees with the local barometric readings. I set it to read the same as the local reading, but it never reads the same again. After setting it multiple times I just gave up and use it as a rather expensive thermometer."
2,"We received this stroller and it was easy to assemble the pieces that needed attached. Very easy instructions. My older son (3 yrs old) loves the sit option and wants to go on a walk all the time. The attachment for the baby seat is super easy to add to the stroller and to remove. I feel secure with the strap that keeps my 1 month old in his carseat- will be strong and sturdy on the stroller. I am very pleased with the outcome of this stroller...if I had to complain about one thing, I would like the seat for the older child to be on a hinge so it's easier to get in the basket below...other than that, I would highly recommend it for anyone with kids around 3 yrs old and a newborn or younger child."
1,"Most features work fine but the speakerphone will produce very loud and high pitch, almost deafening echo sound. I have to tape a bottle cap over the speakerphone button so no one will try to use it. I am looking for another phone now because I bought this phone for its speakerphone feature. It is going to the landfill very soon!"
1,"There is nothing that sets this apart from the flimsy original bic disposables other than the fancy handle. Which doesn't do much because without a pivoting head, you're gripping a bad blade firmer which leads to more cuts around ankles and knees. There are no lubricating strips at all, so the extra price versus an original bic is for a pretty smelling handle. Would rather have pretty legs than a pretty razor."
1,"Any comparison between Plum Sykes and Candace Bushnell is offensive to the latter. Bushnell has created memorable characters (Carrie Bradshaw and Janie Wilcox, for example) and writes about New York society with a knowledge, sense of humor and irony that have been rarely seen since Tom Wolfe wrote ""The Bonfire of Vanities.""What Plum Sykes does, on the other hand, is name-drop: brands (and more brands - is she getting a commission?) clubs, restaurants, etc. Her main character, Moi, is as one-dimensional as a cardboard figure - and about as interesting. Julie Bergdorf is not much better.I forced myself to finish this book because I refused to believe that a best seller could be total and absolute garbage. I kept on thinking that at some point this book just HAD to get better. I was wrong. What a waste of time, money and brain cells. Do yourself a favor: stay away from the Bergdorf Morons."
2,"This is far higher quality than you will find at those stores. Not knocking them, but they are for your casual DIYer. If you want a professional grade saw that's accurate and will last you a very long time, get this one. It's really amazing. BTW, I made sure to get the C10FSH, not the C10FSH-PS which is a newer model made with different, less quality parts made in China. I got this info from the manufacturer. If you can find the older model, get it. Works great with a Freud D1080X Diablo 80 tooth blade."
2,"If you want to hear beautiful songs with deep lyrics wonderfully performed in a perfect amalgamation of rock, folk and ethnic musics get anything by Colin Hay. Along his many other gifts, this guy can really sing. His songs talk about modern life and love in a poetic, lilting manner. If there were 6 stars, I'd give them."
2,"I usually am a movie score fanatic. It pisses me off when they release the songs but not the score. But this is one CD I would buy for the songs. Especially ""More and More"" by Webb Pierce, and ""In the Valley of the Sun"" by Buddy Stuart. Those seem like ""back in the good ol' days"" songs."
2,was a good price for a good product i have only had it for a short time but i have used it at least four times a week just so you are aware the 15 in is at the top narrows down at the base to about 13 1/2 inch
2,This is a good movie. I would suggest you watch it. Good ideas about mental healthcare and it's practices are portrayed on this movie. Jack Nicholson did a great job too.
2,"I have been watching animes my whole life and I have never seen an anime as good as. There has never really been a anime that shown so much of the RPG like stories. And since I love RPG and fantasy this was right up my allie. If you love RPG, Fantasy, and great animes then get this you will love it."
1,"I've owned three jump drives, and this one was by far the worst. It has firmware that you have to work around, and computers often wouldn't recognize this unit, which at one point prevented me from saving valuable data. (I used it on four different PCs, with about a 50% success rate.)Getting the cap aligned just right was a nuisance.I'm very delighted, though, with another Lexar product with the same memory and in the same price range. Go for the newer model."
1,Received TV and installed. Very bad picture. Not acceptable. Defective.Returned and still do not have replacement. Maybe I should get a refund and buy from a reputable supplier.Ron
2,"Justice League: The New Frontier is a good representation of the original Cooke story, but I think it could have benefited from a longer running time and less emphasis on Hal Jordan."
1,"Although the information is located,somewhere, in this edition it is difficult to cut through the use of ""Ye Kings English"" Reading this book is like reading an old kings james version of the Bible.(Not that the KJV is bad, just tasking to get through all the ""Thee's & Thou's) The information about Christmas is in the book, it just seems to take forever to get around the word usage. I also found the order in which the information is presented not easy to follow. In my opinion if you are looking for just ""history of Christmas"" Go some place else FAST, before you fall asleep reading this snoozer! If you so choose to purchase this edition take no-doz and good luck!"
1,"I bought two and both arrived broken. I returned them and the replacements arrived quickly. But they too arrived broken. These are simple items. It is just two optical cables combined into one. But the materials are so inferior that they just break. I just don't know how you can make these so unreliably, but these folks are going out of their way. I don't know how you can make these things to just break when you hook them up. These are inexpensive, but just don't waist your money."
1,"I purchased this work seeking information on the mythical amazons but hoped to find actual historical material on female soldiers. The world is full of women who took up the sword from the Sarmations and Celts to the French Resistence.And history is filled with incidents of individual women who broke from their assigned roles and became soldiers and pirates so with all this truth out there, why did this book put so much focus on: 1) female trennis stars, 2) Xena TV show, 3) Powerpuff Girls cartoon, 4) Buffy TV show and the like?Are women on the battlefield so sparse and uninteresting that Ms Apeles must describe Charlies Angels and the origin of Supergirl to add excitement to her 'work'?Save your money and buy a book that focuses on the reality, not cartoons."
2,"...at least in terms of entertainment. This movie about a group of inept French criminals sent to the United States on a job, find themselves caught up in multiple double-crosses and under fire from the Chicago Mafia. The French crew, led by Gerard Depardieu, are a motley crew but, as it turns out, a likeable bunch. Harvey Keitel shows his great skill as an actor in his ability to make his character both menacing and yet subtly funny which makes the whole movie even more enjoyable. A great ensemble cast for a movie!"
1,"[...]When I was in grade school I could remember the corny holiday card making projects. Those with no originality, which were the majority of kids in school, sprinkled glitter and crappily and happily glued little bows on the card. Those few who rebelled and wanted to differ from the class herd, drew Santa on fire or added some far different materials on it. The point of the metaphor is,Yeah, you love/like Eragon, not so much because it is your genuine preference, but because you do not want to differ from the class herd. That and you probably lack a basic reading in significant literature. But hey, if this author can sell-out and sell his books out, more power to him. You have a right to your opinion. But that doesn't make this book read any less like hackneyed cardboard fantasy prose...it still does."
2,"I just received these earrings, amazingly quickly from Amazon (thank you!) and I really love them. They are tinier than I expected, but they still look beautiful as I prefer small earrings. The sapphires are deep blue, almost black, but they shine in the light, due to their beautiful facets. The diamond in the middle is tiny but it lightens the flower. I'll try to buy the other same earrings with ruby, and emerald."
2,"I have many astrology books, but this one is my favorite. It covers so many important topics in one compact book. This book is also written from a spiritual perspective, taking reincarnation and karma into account. This has become my primary reference book for my astrology hobby."
2,"I'm not much of a fan for Christian fiction, but Ted Dekker is changing my opinion. The book has some interesting thoughts on how time works - God invented it, but how is He outside of time. Did you ever read what C.S. Lewis has to say about time (some of his thoughts are mentioned in this book)? Definitely a page turner. I borrowed this from the church library and am going to buy it so I can loan it out for others to read. For me 4 stars is high praise - I reserve the 5 for classics like C.S. Lewis Mere Christianity, etc."
1,"I am one of Alan's biggest fans, but this new CD disappoints me. AJ, please go back to making traditional country music. Take a lesson from George Srait. Keep it real."
2,"I purchased these for my 1996 Nitro Bass Boat because the struts that hold up the compartment doors were shot and not doing anything to hold the doors up. These are a perfect replacement and work great. No more will my boat hit a wave while fishing and the rod locker door slam shut on me while trying to get a rod. Very easy to replace, too. Would definitely recommend."
2,"This was the first piece of Viking cookware I purchased and I have never ever regretted spending the money! It cooks evenly without hot spots. And I use it all of the time. Viking is the best stainless cookware I have ever used, and I have All-Clad, too. This is better! The handle makes it really easy to grip and lift. This pan is well worth the money."
1,"I really liked Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas, so I thought I'd check this out. I didn't think it was worth my time. The books seemed exactly alike - especially the tone of the character's writing style (Suzanne vs. Sam). It seemed clear that since Suzanne's Diary did so well, the author decided to write a book exactly like it. It was an incredibly predictable love story."
2,"Rob Zombie's latest flick, House of 1000 Corpses was not what i first expected..It was better! I thought this was going to be some italian gorefest rip off, but it turned out to be a sick, twisted horror film with flavor. The plot, while not anything new, gets the movie from beginning to end, but it's the Characters that stand out. Sid Haig as Dr. Spaulding takes the cake. His flair and wild one liners are great( just watch the entire menu before making a selection on the DVD..very funny! ). The wacky cast from the seductive to the bizzare are worth a look. The movie takes a turn half way in by actual corpses comimg to life for the finale. Most of the reviews are mixed with this movie, but i still think you should see for yourself. If you are in the right frame of mind, you will be surprised with House of 1000 Corpses. Destined to become a classic. What a ride! Thanks Rob!"
1,Santa brought this game to my 3 year old and let me tell you it sucked. I couldnt get it to work on any of the three computers I have (one of which runs Win 98). He stills cries almost daily to play the game and it has been over two months. I will not buy from Atari again it is not worth the nightmare of watching my Thomas fanatic son cry.
2,"I used this at a relatives home, and was very impressed with the hard boiled eggs. I've used mine several times now, and am still impressed! I do find that it's easier to peel the eggs after they have cooled to the touch, rather than after they have been refrigerated."
1,"I enjoyed the provocative information about the Magdalene but it was spoiled by a mediocre ""who dunnit."" The killer (big psycho guy, lacking melanin) was something I'd have attributed to Monty Python. I recommend borrowing it from a friend or the library."
1,I bought it for my kids music class. This violin couldn't be tuned. The bridge won't stay in place. Ripoff!
1,"We have a 2-year old who can open all doors with ease. We put on these covers to stop her from wandering outside without our knowledge and she promptly openned the door with the protective cover on it.It does slow her down in opening the door, but she can still do it rather consistently."
2,"I was actually a little surprised at how well this piece preformed. In this case, you could also grab a third-party network adapter if you wanted to save a few bucks, admittedly, Microsoft's unit is a little bit expensive. However, for a difference of ten or twenty dollars, there's not a world of performance difference and you won't have another device taking up space in your entertainment setup.Installation was a snap and it was very easy to configure the adapter to pick up my network. It's ease of use was definitely a pleasant surprise! I'm a little curious as to why this wasn't maybe bundled with an xBox Live subscription? Oh well, recommended highly, a great accessory to a great console system!"
1,"A reviewer on the paperback (Booklist, in a starred review) compared this to the best of Patricia Cornwell. No comparison. Cornwell is graphic, and her habit of having criminals stalk her characters instead of the other way around can be wearing, but her scientific jargon (while keeping the jist available to the reader) is of a much higher quality than this. The obvious leads to a further plot development in this book (dropped in casual conversation, and ignored at the time by the characters involved) are unlikely. Dialogue is stilted. Good scientific skills and their basis are articulated, and interesting basic forensic skills, both criminal and anthropological, are introduced. It's a good start."
2,"I thought I had pretty good taste when it comes to spiffing up the ol' homestead. Catherine Bailly Dunne showed me how hopelessly inept I really am. Her sense of style is a force unto itself. Colors and textures come alive with her inventive, yet simple flourishes. This book is ideal for beautifying any home, from a one-bedroom rathole to a multi-gabled country estate. Hats off to the author. Catherine, you've really dunne it this time!"
1,"I was expecting to hear some extremely original and great music, but this definitely misses the mark. This is an artist trying to sound like other artists, SRV, John Mellencamp, etc. If you were to hear this music you would know its wasn't the artists he is trying to sound like, and probably wouldn't want to hear repeatedly. His voice is fairly weak and indistinct and his guitar is so muddied it is hard to tell what he is trying to achieve. He might be fun to see at your local pub on a Saturday night, but if you like good rock and good blues, buy something by SRV, Eric Clapton, or Gary Moore. I thought this was going to be a revelation, but the only thing it revealed; listen to Johnny Lang for better vocals, guitar, and arrangements; for a young up and comer. This CD is going back to the store for an exchange or trade, but it won't be spinning in the player."
2,"They're cheaper than ""bare skin"" condoms, and they're still thin enough for me. They feel great and most importantly my girl likes them too. I keep a ton of these handy. Excellent choice!"
2,"Phenomenal and quick read that shifts readers to a more child-like perspective. A fun way to escape the world of to do lists. I can't wait to read the next.Beyond the book, I am extremely impressed by its artistic integrity: the binding, the paper, the font (and explainations at the back). In a world that people don't slow down enough to notice the details this book forces you to stop and think about the basics all the way down to the origins of the Garamond font. This is what good publishing and design is about!Also, it reminds me of a 5th grade version of the Jasper Fforde books: Tuesday Next series and Nursry Crime series. If you are a high school student or adult reader and you like the Sisters Grimm look into Fforde."
2,I have had these speakers almost four years. no complaints at all. take up small amount of space in a home office. use them with a 2009 MacBook Pro. Really can generate great sound. Bass output thumping! (shakes the floor below if really crank it up.... and even with sound only partway turned up..) would highly recommend. very good value for what you pay.
1,took way to long how long does it really take to get a code read it think it would be fast not up to 4 hours lol what a joke i guess thats what i get for reading that would be a digital code sent to me instantly
1,Zatch Bell is an amazing series but only for a certain amount of episodes. Here Zatch is put as a children's show and you can tell by all the editing and episodes of them taking nothing seriously. Then you have more episodes that are annoying and pointless. There's too much playing going on in this series and it seems to be so they can stretch it into a long long series and it doesn't have to be. It's a great show but with a lot of unneeded baggage and these episodes fall into that spot.
2,For the price you really cannot beat this player!!!512MB is not as big as I thought it would be but it's the perfect podcast player as it's easy as anything to trash and replace episodes.
2,"That about sums this record up. A blend of psychedelic soul-rock, early Stooges wah-wah abuse and vaguely T. Rex-ish glammy posturing, ex-Make Uppers rock it. Not as great as Make Up, and Ian doesn't sing about food as much as he used to, but hell, it's good rock and roll. This album makes me laugh, but not in an embarrassed, ""Oh, it's so terrible"" sort of way. ""I Suck on That Emotion"" is a great joke. Something this over the top has to be good. ""The Scene Creamers are the sexually transmitted band,"" the members say. heh heh heh..."
1,"This tea is a blend, not simply just Green Tea leaves. Though the ingredient list states this, the name and label do not. Is Celestial Seasonings cutting costs this way? It's safe to wonder. It would be nice if the name was altered to reflect its true nature: a potpourri."
2,Bought this book for my grandfather who is a history nut. he says this book is both informative and hilarious. My review is based on that. I have not read it.
1,"I've been a Ben Stiller fan, but this one reminds me of the last of the ""Smokey and the Bandit"" films... They all had a wonderful time re-writing the script every night while they were buzzed. They had lots of fun making this, I did not enjoy viewing this piece of trash... Fortunately, a friend showed it to me before I opened my copy -- which I returned for a refund. Don't waste your money, it's a bomb."
1,"Well what can I say, Moby has done it again. He has successfully produced a terrible cd that almost gives electronic music a bad name. The question is, when will people quit wasting their money on his albums? When that day comes, maybe Moby will hang it up and quit polluting the airwaves with garbage. The only thing Moby is good at is whining and complaining about the decent music being relaesed. (No, don't stand up so fast Slim Shady, I'm not talking about you) According to Moby, we are all made of stars. Well at least his video was. Maybe I'm not giving ""18"" enough credit. It does sound good while being ejected from a cd player and thrown from a moving car. Lets all do the music industry a favor and buy cds that are actually worth listening to. Then we might not have to worry about more noise pollution from Moby and other MTV darlings that don't deserve a record deal in the first place."
1,"As much as I wanted to see this movie with an objective mind without the influence of me liking one of the actors in this film. It still became truly difficult to enjoy this movie, it started out horrible and it end horribly. Sure the CGI was good better then most movies who have tried and failed to use CGI, but couldn't have they focused on the script also. The actors I think tried to make do with what they had, but even their acting came out duller then a bad joke done by Michael Richards. As much as I hate saying it and writing it these actors may need to go back to acting school. I know its all about money in this world but really what were these producers thinking as they said, ""We are going to release this in the U.S. and its going to be huge?"" Yeah a huge waste of time, at least I didn't spend money actually watching this. A huge relief on that part."
1,"but these people don't 'come alive' for me in any meaningful way. By the end of the book I felt silly for having read it as if I had just travelled back to elementary school and was reading something from way back then. It had an adult theme, but the characters could have just walked off the set of Full House and the way they interacted with eachother made me embarrassed for them, since they haven't matured since gradeschool.The time line was very awkward as well. Chapter 1: 'And suddenly a month went by and nothing much happened'. Chaper 2: 'I drove out to see so and so today, and she said woof, yay!'Much of the same throughout the book. You basically aren't allowed to develop any meaningful connections to the characters and sticking with the story becomes very difficult at various points. I stuck with the book hoping against hope that it would eventually get better. It didn't."
1,"I originally purchased this DVD because of the other good reviews. I was very disappointed because there was not much footage of jaguars, nor was much research presented. Rather, this was a documentary of the jaguar researcher. You hear about his troubled childhood, you meet his mentor, you meet his wife and children, you see him in the hospital being treated for cancer, and you see his entire life story, etc. etc. It's not this this information is not interesting, but I wanted to see a nature documentary, and this essentially is a biography on a scientist. I would say less than 1/3 of the DVD shows actual footage of jaguars. If you want to see a pure nature documentary, do not waste your money on this."
1,"Be prepared to kick the back wheels. I'm only 5'5"". Very disappointing. Also, you have to use your hand(s) to fold it."
2,After using multiple covers these are the best we have found. They leave the least amount of indentions in the seats as others do. The only draw back is they separate easy when the are getting installed due to the velcro.
1,Wow... now I can see this glorified cover band in full digital video and 5:1 dolby audio. I guess it is fun to try and count all the north face jackets in the crowd. Try saving your money and buy a new identity instead... Just remember.. if you can't dance..just panic man. Panic.
2,This is a book about teachers being openminded and letting a child be creative instead of following all the strigent guildlines. Every teacher should read this book!
2,This book is full of fun activities that can be used in my classroom. I would recommend this book to any Language Arts teacher!
2,"Would absoultely reccomend for those that do alot of listening to their small boomoxes, CD players , walkmans, Sirius stillettos or S-50s and any other portable or regular home audio devices."
1,"The book only offers some insight into a realistic game production pipeline; it tries to cover subjects from ""Fun"" theory to BASIC to small Physics equations to Artistry.As an introductory book it is -ok- in these respects; however, I just suppose I found myself disagreeing with alot of the subject matter that is presented. Especially when it came to the design section, they try to put in the ""waterfall"" flow of design into game design which just seems too counter productive to be a realistic methodology for developing a game. Especially if you're only an 'entry' level designer."
1,"I bought the book, read it, and thought it mightwork for me. I was at about 270 - 275 lbs for quitea few years. That was in 1999. By 01/01/00 I hit300 lbs. That was the straw that broke my back.My doctor was complaining about heart palpatations,High cholesterol and High Tri-glicerides. I knewsomething had to change.I did an internet search on Triglicerides, and foundthe Atkins diet. I bought two or three of his books.By 01/01/01 (a year later), I dropped 60 lbs. My doctorwas thrilled with the weight loss but didn't care for thehigher cholesterol. I weened myself off of the Atkins(then I was 205), and the blood stats couldn't be better.Not to mention he took me off of my high blood pressuremeds! That doesn't happen too often :)."
1,"Sullen, confused, pensive, self-questioning? Why? the very qualities we loved about Harry are now caught up in teen angst. Is the next volume going to be about his sexual escapades?She is trying to keep up with her aging audience, but in doing so, she is losing the new one, and the world of wonder."
2,"Jon Gindick is nothing short of genius. I've suffered through several books on blues harp without much success. Gindick had me blowing acceptable harp after 2 days. Gindick is an expert. That is not unusual. His ability to convey what he does and how he does it is rare. He shows you the technique was well as what will and what won't work. Gindick maps out the harmonica in such a way that you can play along with any 12 bar blues and not make a mistake. The easy to understand music theory was the key that unlocked the door for me.Gindick guides you from the basics to the intricate in an easy and enjoyable pace. One of the first tunes he teaches is a bluesy rendition of ""Amazing Grace"" which sounds great from the moment you first practice it.If your goal is to be able to play harmonica that sounds great in a very short period of time, Rock n' Blues Harmonica essential. I only regret that I didn't stumble across this book first."
1,"My child HAD to have it. Once she got it with two additional cartridges sold seprately, she found it boring."
2,"I first saw Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) in a video arcade, and thought that it looked fun but overpriced, as are most coin-op games these days. A couple of years later, my boyfriend's roommate lends me his copy and a mat, and all of a sudden I'm spending all my spare time excersizing! Most of my friends are amazed (I'm generally about as couch potatoish as one gets), but the game itself is well thought out and addicting; and with the added benefit of good excersize, how can it go wrong? I just hope my grades don't suffer!"
1,"Not the most riveting book out there about the Manson clan, with large sections of the text lifted virtually verbatim from ""Helter Skelter"".Murphys' original material is also fairly unenlightening . For interesting new information on the subject read Jess Bravins' sensitive biography of Lynette Fromme, ""Squeaky""."
2,"Crisfield's first and second books are excellent sources for anyone from different disiplines. His success can be attributed to explaining the materials in their simple forms and to his notations that is easy to follow. Starting from 1D nonlinear truss elements to 3D beam-column elements, all concepts are explained in a similar way so once you are into it, it is easy to follow the text. I mostly studied his work on finite rotations, and arc-length algorithms."
1,I purchased a new popper and at the same time purchased three bags of this popcorn. I am on the second bag now. I don't know why but this popcorn doesn't pop fully and I don't think it is the popper or me. I have varied the heat and oil levels so I think the popcorn may have a moisture or freshness issue or just something else. I store it after opening in a jar in a cool dark cabinet.I won't purchase this again even though it claims to be organic.
1,"ok... so take two great films and put them on one dvd for a low price! BRILLIANT! except for one thing: THE BIGGEST MISMATCH OF ALL TIME. /le sigh... seriously, what were they thinking?! ""hey! i know what will go GREAT paired with Rain Man: FARGO! after seeing Peter Stormare shove the various parts of Steve Buschemi afterward being shot down by Frances Macdormond on a frozen pond, people will LOVE to see the most genuinely heart-warming performance by either Dustin Hoffman or Tom Cruise!"" see what i'm saying? i love both of these films, personally, but this ""convenient"" pack is about as convenient as packing uh... bricks and peaches together? geniuses on the corporate end on this one."
1,"I read the last book with these characters and enjoyed it mostly so I thought I'd give this book a try. What a mistake. The plot was just too out there to follow, the characters are poorly defined (i.e., the all ""sound"" the same so it's hard to determine who is speaking), and the drug use didn't seem to have any purpose at all. Additionally, the book just didn't seem to flow well when read. Too many thoughts left out perhaps."
1,"The Bean Trees and the Animal Dreams just consume the reader, the Poisonwood Bible just confuses the reader. In all her other book I cared about the main characters, but she has not managed to carry that wonderful writing to this book. With the poisonwood bible, I am finishing the book solely because I started it."
2,When i was down reading this book i wished for one that contuned about this book. I can't get out of my mind about the pain and suffering that Anna went through.She was so great! She helped Kala and her mother and her anut and oma while she could.Also helped deliver fake ids to people in Le Chambon. Also Rudi was great too.I loved at the end when Anna and Rudi got together.I thought that the love Rudi gave to Anna helped Anna get throug the war and get over the border line to Swizzerland. I love this book and hope that they will come out with another one just like this!!
2,We love this dart board. It is very nice and has the bears logo even on the darts! My only small complaint is there were just a few little nicks on the wood but honestly my dad may have done that while hanging it up. Otherwise I HIGHLY recommend!
2,this thing is great. it gives you nice massage and keeps your feet warm. just love it. very user friendly.
1,This is not the original Winnie the Pooh movie that we had on VHS years ago. My son watched my tape a while back and fell in love with the story but the tape messed up halfway through so I ordered this movie thinking it was the same thing. The characters voices are different and its a completely different story.. It's a good movie but not at all what I thought it was.
1,Oh i didn't read a worse book than this.I hate Leo and Kate.I hate Titanic.This is an awful book.Don't read it!
1,"For those of you who are unhappy with the fake widescreen format on the cartoons, here is a customer service number for Warner Home Entertainment. This is a voice mail set up specifically for consumer feedback on their DVD product:818-977-6065Be polite yet firm. Make sure to suggest the idea of a disc replacement program."
1,"Beware It's a bad imitation!!!!!!!! Completely fake, fake smell, fake jar, fake all around..... Save your money!! It didn't smell right, maybe cause it seems to be the original 60 or so more times diluted!!"
1,"My 1st shipment of this sewing machine had a broken part. Then when I received my replacement one, the machine was worse. It was making a grinding noise. I like Singer sewing machines but this model is defective. Do not buy- you will regret it.."
1,"I do not like what this company did to me, after I started studing, ebook stopped working , and said it is now expired, I e-mailed the company and told them that I am still studing and when I bought it it never said that it is only good for few months, they told me they will send me an e-mail with a link to get only one more month but they never did , even so I sent them 6 e-mails but never e-mailed me back. I am very very unhappy with this company"
1,"As other reviewers have said, this product ""runs"" on Windows XP- if you download an additional program to allow it to run. The KQ6 is the original version rather than the more attractive second version, which was disappointing. The games are worth playing mostly for sentimental value, and they are fun, but this isn't the best release of these games."
2,"A great lotion, that works well at moisturizing and leaving dry chapped hands feeling better. It is also available at Walmart for the same price."
1,"Lately Disney is making wrong choices with their shows. Zorro is a well loved series, and very much popular. You'd think that when Disney put this series on dvd, that it would be on sale for 2-4 years or so. I know there is a profit in selling the box set. So why did Disney decided to sell the set for a limited of 30,000??? That makes no sense. The box set came out in Nov 09, and 3-4 months later it's already Out Of Print. Seems pointless to sell the series, and then discontinue it so short of time. Very disappointing."
2,"This is a short book that I read slowly...savoring the story, its unfolding evolution of human potentials and the creation of spiritual enlightenment. This is a book about growing and responding to the challenges to one's consciousness and the provocations of events in a boy's life. Yet, I think there are universal themes to which we can all relate. The story is woven together with characters, events, and subjects that give a sense of fear and courage, dread and hope, and limitations and releases. It evoked reflections on my youth and the future. Worthy of each moment of time in the reading!!!"
1,Get a slicer that is of higher quality. I consider this one a loss and do not use it. It is dull and flimsy.
1,"I usually love Lori Foster's novels, but this one was a disappointment from the very beginning. Her lead male character comes off as pushy and completely unbelievable from the onset of the story. From there the reader is led through a half baked story that ends so abruptly and half-finished that I kept wondering where Foster stuck the rest of her manuscript. She resolved the little half baked plot, but still left the characters dangling at the end. I hope her next one is better or I may have to start borrowing copies to read instead of actually buying them."
2,"Substantial food, not a tiny treat. I keep them in the car for my 3 year old and I when we are on the go."
2,"Mravinsky is the prime exemplar of a faster performance tradition of Shostakovich's Eighth Symphony, presumably countenanced by the composer himself. This is in direct contrast to modern interpretations advocated by the Russian conductors Mstislav Rostropovich, Dmitri Kitayenko and Rudolf Barshai, as well as André Previn. But there is more to a performance than tempo. Mravinsky generates a nearly manic intensity in the third movement that no one has matched, and, despite his generally fast tempos, effectively communicates the power and suffering inherent in Shostakovich's anti-war masterpiece. As a pure performance this rates five stars, but the mediocre sound and atrocious audience noise make it a four star recording which should nevertheless be in the collection of anyone seriously interested in the music of Shostakovich. Arthur B. Lintgen"
1,This is typical of King after his initial glory. It gets off to a good start and the possibilities seem interesting. But then nothing happens. There is the occasionally disembodied event but they never go anywhere. It is set in Western Pennsylvania not Maine and in the afterward the author explains why. To me this is a prime example of the reality that his publisher would print his laundry receipt and it would sell so no editor would ever have the nerve to say this is 200 pages too long. King makes his usual snide political comments. This was written in 2002 and as we know the author's concern for nutty domestic militia movements is what America had to keep its eye on at the time. My wife got it from a discount bin so I'm not out much but it was still overpriced.
2,this book really helped me a lot. I also contacted E Kain for some diffuculties and he responded the very next day. I feel every MFC developer is incomplete without this book by his side.Eagerly awaiting the future editions of this title
2,"Sorry, but the CD doesn't come close to the real thing, baby! It's OK, but it's only 10% of the whole. For one thing, it cuts out the entire snare-line's riff. Blasphemy! Buy the video instead! Buy two. You'll wear one out in the first week. If you're just getting a taste of this stuff for the first time, you have only scratched the surface, my friend. Check out a drum corp show next summer (see dci.org). And please, never call us dorky again!"
1,I have not experienced an even warm cup of tea let alone hot since using this product. I tried pre-heating it and still no results. Very disappointed. I positively don't recommend this product.
1,"What happened to the Paul Bunyan I remember from my childhood? This version has been dumbed down, sweetened up and turned into drivel. There is virtually nothing left of the stories I remember from my youth. Since when did Paul fight Gumberoos, make a popcorn blizzard or put green lensed glasses on Babe? I borrowed this book from the library because my boys and I were reading about the mid 1800's when the American tall tale originated, but this book was a not a good representation of that heritage."
2,"This cookbook contains contest-winning recipes from the _Vancouver Sun_. The five sections cover recipes with common BC ingredients, traditional British recipes, Asian-inspired dishes, Italian food, and chocolate. All the recipes are relatively simple to prepare, and the ""success tips"" down the side of the page ensure they'll come out good. But the real reason to buy this cookbook isn't for the salmon with roasted red pepper sauce or lamb chops with chutney. The recipe for ""Chocolate-Dipped Cappuccino Shortbread"" makes _Five Star Food_ deserve a place on your cookbook shelf."
2,"I love Rachael's 30 minute meals. I have several of her books, watch her show several times a week, and I look up new recipes on foodtv.com. Rachael has the nation's cure for obesity: get out of the Burger Kings and McDonalds and start cooking your own food again! This book makes this possible.Many people are put off because there are no pictures and no index. Don't let this deter you! This was Rachael's very first book published, way before her spot on FoodTV, and was intended to be a local publication in upstate New York as a companion to the spot she did on the local news. Because of its local disturbution, it was very low buget. Maybe one day the publishers will allow her to redo the book, but that is their decision and not hers.Get the book and get back to cooking."
1,"Very poor plot, the movie is so boring: there are so many unnecessary scenes which just make it boring. YAWN!Don't waste your time with this movie, seriously."
1,"I read this book about 10 years ago, thinking it was a child's book. I got it off a 50 cent library table. It is intelligently written, but a heartbreaking chronicle of the life of a purebred Pointer kennel, and the greatest product of that kennel. It describes pointer trials in detail, and is interesting. However, the cruel beginning and sad end make this a little too much reality for any child. This might be a good read for a hunter, but I'd never give it to a youngster."
2,"I brought this for my dad, he likes it because it play all sort of DVD including the minor scratches DVD."
1,I presently have a white mesh Travel Time Mule in a size 8 narrow that I wore all last summer. I enjoyed it so much that I purchased the same shoe this past fall again but in a black suede in a size 8 narrow. Both pairs of shoes fit perfectly. Now today I received my Travel Time white leather mule in a size 8 narrow and it is much much too wide. I am disappointed that Easy Spirit has made so much of a change in their narrow width shoes. I will not purchase this Travel Time shoe again
1,This is a garbage movie. The only thing worse than the beginning and middle of the movie was the end! The movie is an insult to not only those unfortunate to watch it but also to the actors. I feel sorry that Melanie Griffith had to play such a disgusting and trite role. And all the lines in the movie are trash.
1,"This razor does look nice but I feel as if that is all it does. When it came to me in the mail, I had to sharpen the edge and hone it because it was not sharpened. When I did get a nice edge, and finally used it it would not hold the edge worth anything. In my opinion you are better off using this money on a better made blade with a harder steel. Also I would not recommend a new user on getting this one because they will have a miserable experience."
2,"I enjoyed Myth II: Soulblighter when I was in college. Back then my laptop could barely manage to present the game with its demand for fast processor and 3D acceleration and all. I always wanted to play Myth TFL. Now's my chance and I was not disappointed. If you know the games, you'll know what I'm talking about. Bring back memories. Enjoyed them. I had to go online and download a few ""patches"" and I still need to use cd to play Myth TFL, even thought I fully installed it. But all in all. I'm sure to enjoy these games for years, hopefully, to come."
2,"Martineau does a great job introducing us to the ""coincidences"" that surround Earth, and in fact let us exist. However, he wrongly states, ""No modern theory exists to explain the miracle of conscious life nor the cosmic coincidences that surround our planet."" This is untrue, Intelligent Design Theory (IDT) does just that. (Martineau even asks ""Is this design?"" on p. 2.)For more on IDT see books like ""The Creator and the Cosmos"" by Hugh Ross who has been documenting the cosmic ""coincidences"" for 20 years. See also Dembski's ""Intelligent Design"" & ""Signs of Intelligence.""There are other great books in this Wooden Book series: ""Sacred Geometry,"" ""Stonehenge"" and ""Sun, Moon & Earth"""
2,"I rated Quickbooks Pro 2003 as very poor (one star) but this one really surged forward for our business. The huge feature to me was the addition of the ability to duplicate fields on invoice/statement templates so we can use tear-off strips that have all invoice information. Our invoices/statements now look very high-end and customers like them better. I find lots to like about this new software and find it was worth the upgrade money for this alone.Hopefully without sounding protectionist, one feature I very much dislike is the Indian-based customer service. Not only were they difficult to converse with, but they had a very 'don't care' attitude (3 calls over past 6 months.) I am always pleased when I call and get US based representatives."
2,"If you enjoy the tinkling sound of music boxes, and love Phantom or Pirates, you will adore this album.It is -beautiful- to relax or read to, especially if you set it on repeat or shuffle/random. I can only imagine the gorgeous dreams one would have if you fell asleep to this!My only tiny complaint about it is that each selection is about 2 minutes max. I could listen to one selection for a good ten, even fifteen, minutes before getting tired of it.I am personally only a Phantom 'phan,' but I would suggest this to -anyone- who likes listening to music boxes.Especially PORTER music boxes.If you have yet to ever hear a Porter Music Box in person...find one at a store (Christmas Dove??) near you...and you will enter Heaven! :)"
2,"I could not put the book down, I had to find out what insane thing Delores would do next! This book is truly great."
2,I've not used the item yet. It's purpose is to serve as an improvised bed for travel around the country. It should be adequate to the purpose (although I would have appreciated being able to find a thicker version).
1,"I downloaded this just to spite them in the first place. But after listening to it, I cannot believe my ears. I deleted all the mp3s immediately. This album is horrendous. Complete trash. It's hard to believe this guys are metal legends after listening to this album. Stick with the 80's Metallica if you're wanting to hear good stuff. Ugh!"
2,"Words are not needed in this great photo essay in life of violence and tragedy in America. Ordinary places, amazing events. The corner where MADD's founded was killed by a drunk driver, Love Canal, Imperial Food Fire, the former Store where Emmett Tills whistled at a white woman and was brutally killed, Polly Klass, Magan Kanka, Yummy Sandifer, Waco, OK Fed Building. All memories that rose anew when I read the book. It sits on my desk at work as reminder that we should never forget these tragic events."
1,"I was very dissapointed in this AS book. I have loved most all of her books but this one. The book has - child beating, sexual abuse of a child and the hero is even sorta a pig. If you are expecting one of AS's normal Scottish Romances I suggest you find another of her books. I did not find any chemistry between Melissa and Nick and Sir Geoffrey is well... to say to much would ruin the book for someone else."
1,Just a big bore. No anointing on it. It's going to the local libray book sale. Maybe you can get it there.
2,"Just the controversial nature alone that this CD has always produced should be enough to entice a collector to listen to this body of work. It is clear from track 1 that the Stones are attempting to produce music that they are not comfortable with. But that is precisely the genius of this CD: they did it and, given the competition at that time, they did it extremely well!! It is indeed unfortunate that the events following this CD's release caused them to abandon further experimentation into psychedelia; for if this CD is any indication, they would certainly have become masters in this genre in very short order."
2,Glad I found this because mine were quite old. I do notice the newer ones are not as great as the orignal because one of mine is already chipped with normal use.I love the size.
2,"Whether you are a man or a woman, if you're in the corporate world or work in an office, this is an essential book to own. It will revolutionize your earning potential. It covers all aspects of the work experience from interviewing to getting a raise to leaving successfully. His advice about how often you should switch jobs is wroth the price of the book, easily.R. Don Steele's blunt language is a rare find in today's world, and his straightforwardness helps convey his messages. If you read this book carefully, you'll realize he truly cares about telling you everything he knows about the subject. He is clearly passionate about educating his readers, and his language and thoroughness show that.I truly wish I had read this book before I had graduated college. I'm lucky I found it during my second job."
2,"Though suitable for road or mountain bike, the heavier duty cable on the Cateye Enduro 8 make it better able to withstand the abuse of offroad cycling. The Cateye Mity is the same computer with standard cabling and can sometimes be found for less."
2,"This is the first Nero Wolfe novel but not the first Nero Wolfe investigation: Nero and Archie have been together for some years, and some people owe them great debts of gratitude. Like many later stories, this is largely set in Westchester County. There is a definite affinity with P. G. Wodehouse in the mixture of accuracy and escapist fantasy."
2,New quality arrived before expected date great condition great service all around great experience. Would totally order from seller again and would reccommend both the dvd and the seller to others
2,"This is a disturbing, intensely pure work.Belongs on any serious music lover's open-minded shelf."
2,"Excellent book, it is like talking to grandpa, you get great advise and good little anticdotes from a long history of golf."
2,"This book is perfect for people who ""learn as they code""(as oppose to those who learn as they read).Each task is well defined with clear problem statement andeasy-to-follow implementation steps.Better yet, all implementations are backed by ""best practice"" --which means you won't get embarrased at work during code reviews :)This book is also great for developers who know the basics andare now thinking, ""what else can I do with Struts?""There are lots to explore... and this book will open the door for you."
2,"If you need chemical assistance to enjoy and perhaps find a deeper meaning to music, don't bother with this one. This beautiful cd was compiled by Quango's Bruno Guez and is a taste of some ""Cosmic Funk"". Not earthy, heavy funk like some might have expected. The title says it all. If you are up for the experience, go for it. One thing, it is light! Very light! Don't expect this cd to go head to head with some Maggottron rebirth or anything of the likes. This one is for chillin out.Almost sounds like african rythyms. Latin??? get a life!"
1,"worst CD I ever bought, some people with an otherwise good taste in music have this CD, but don't listen to them. highly unorganized, with the single worst singing voice i have ever heard. this isn't music."
2,"You will love the Prophecy. It's really good. I like it when Aldrea enters Cassie's mind. Aldrea is very strong. So, read the Prophecy."
2,"For those of you who like to see ""numbers on paper"" instead of on a computer screen, this is the book for you. Easy to capture your miles and other workouts on a weekly basis with this journal. This journal also goes hand-in-hand with the Runner's World Big Book of Marathon and Half-Marathon Training. Buy them both - you wont be disappointed."
1,Broken after 3 uses. warranty does not cover. $75 to ship replacement parts. going into garbage. $130 wasted.
2,"Dead Bank Walking is a fascinating account of the rise and demise of a stalwart California Bank. Smith's narration is personal, and it eloquently captures the excess and arrogance that accompanied big business in the 80's. More importantly, it brings the complexity of senior management decision making to life by providing the content and detail required for the reader to effectively walk in the shoes of this aggressive CEO. Smith takes you inside the emotional roller-coaster of his mega-merger. From the comedic meetings with the period's renegade personalities to the devastating effects FIRREA's fine print had on Security Pacific's solvency, this book is a great read. You won't put it down!"
2,"This version of the ""Greatest sea story ever"" might not be the most historically accurate but is the most spectacular and entertaining for my money. The acting is top-notch from all of the cast and the on location setting of french polynesia is visually stunning. ( only a few scenes of the 1935 original were filmed on location) I personally get a charge seeing locales in the movie that I have actually been at ( this movie I will add, inspired seven trips to Tahiti and Bora Bora) All in all a highly entertaining movie that I never tire of, the letterbox version is a must and something all movie lovers should appreciate. so much is lost in the pan and scan. ignore all the negatives you have heard about, this is a top rate film"
1,"I bought this radio because of the good reviews. I liked the digital tuning. It was very easy to lock on stations and the presets are also a nice feature. The sound quality was another story. Many of the other reviewers had commented on the very good sound quality, but the unit I bought sounded so bad that neither my wife, nor I could listen to it for more than a few minutes. Actually it sounded like what you would expect from such a small radio. I might have just purchased a defective unit. I just can't imagine how anyone could say my radio sounds very good or even ok. If you are thinking about buying one, check out the return policy. I sent mine back and I think I'm going to get hit with postage both ways plus a restocking fee. Ouch!"
2,"Considering that Enemymine is the work of Zack Sally, Danny Sasaki and Mike Kunka you might wonder how a double bass - one drummer band works. The answer is heavy and quite well. This EP contains my favorite song by Enemymine: I've Got the Ice in Me. However, the EP is quite heavy and the sounds that Kunka and Sally create with their basses is incredible. Sadly, like godheadSilo, Enemymine was not all that well known. If you are interested in Dead Low Tide or Smoke and Smoke give Enemymine (and godheadSilo) a try."
2,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas! She is a huge Grinch fan! She already had the DVD, but wanted it on Blu-ray! She was very excited to get it! It shipped fast and was exactly as advertised!"
1,"This was just as bad if not worse than the first season of Dark Angel. I know it's improper to mix genres like that, but this anime was just plain bad. The plot is insipid and like a previous reviewer stated, I'll watch anything with Fan Service. Although this show had an abundance of Fan Service, I could not bear anymore half way through disc two. Most of the characters are contemptuous if not down right detestable and the plot is lacking severely. Please do yourselves a favor and avoid this anime like the plague."
2,"First, this book has a lot of laugh out loud moments. If you want to read a great modern humor writer, read this book.However, the plot is not magical and left me feeling so much more could have been done exploring Death mythos.SPOILERSCharlie isn't THE Death. He's a death. There are lots of guys like him. They don't exactly know what they're doing, or why what they're doing helps anybody. They can't even talk to each other for reasons never quite explained.That sucks the fun out of reading a book about becoming death, but hey, maybe Mr. Moore (who I've never read before) will still make this a comic exciting romp.But the ending just happens. There's no real sense of fufillment. Supposedly there's going to be a showdown of mythical deaths to be the one true Death... but not very many deaths show up. The one that wins doesn't seem to have any history like the others do."
2,"I received the product I needed, in due time. I am thankfull because all the drugstores and supermarkets I went to , in different USA cities, we're always out of stock ."
2,They're Microsoft points for Xbox Live. What else is there to say about them other than they're a digital currency used to purchase digital items via Xbox Live.Transaction was fast.E-mail came right away.Code worked.No mailing or physical card required.It's everything I expected it to be.
2,"The book is pretty much like life, well for the popular rich kids. Yup the world of popularity pretty much revolves around great clothes, and style, and being a social butterfly, and being well a little or very spoiled. Coming from the regular side it's kind of fun to see how the other half lives, instead of some mean girls having fun all the time and being brats they are showing them as regular teenagers with lives other than glamorous and pulling schemes on Claire, and trying to get a boyfriend. Who knew popular kids have other emotions rather than hate and schemes and great taste in fashion??PS: This review sounds geeky.CHOKING HAZARD: if you have read the all of my stupid conversation you might laugh so hard at my idiocy and geekiness that you will choke and might possibly die.."
1,This book has all of the usual defects of books from Kluwer Academic Publishers. Acronyms in the text and terms in equations are not defined. Diagrams have errors. It seems to be a cut and paste job with very little systematic development of the subject. Graphs of CAD program outputs are presented with no or very little comment or discussion. There is one case of a technical error. A mathematical program output which claims to show the effects of amplifier noise figure really illustrates the beneficial effects of dithering data to overcome the effects of finite word length in FFT calculations.
1,"I've enjoyed the prior books in this series. However, I found this one plodding, and too wrapped up in emotional melodrama and inner conflicts. While I've eagerly and quickly read through prior books, I've noticed that this one was an effort to finish. Everyone has their own preferences, but less introspection and more action in the next book would be welcome."
2,"I have been using an old (20 yr) serger but decided to treat myself to a new one when it came time to get it adjusted yet again this year. For slightly less than two years charges of adjustments I have gotten a machine that is far above what sergers used to do.Last weekend I made a set of draperies and bed skirts using both a heavy fabric and a light-weight one. The Brother serger went from one to the other and back again without adjustment and looked wonderful in both cases. My suggestion is if you are using an older serger, treat yourself to the new features like lay-in threading and easy to thread lower loopers that were plagues of the older sergers. If you are looking for a first serger this one will fill the bill. I like it so well I went out and bought me a new Brother 6100 Sewing Machine to go with it."
1,"I bought these mugs because the reviews indicated that they were sturdy and chip resistant. That is not the case. I broke a handle off on my first use. Within a week, I saw a chip on another. It was a small chip and I was able to put some fingernail polish on to hide the chip. I consider myself a careful person, but the slighest ding and a chip occurs.I can't reccomend them to anyone unless they are used for display only. The color and style is beautiful but everyday use is not for these mugs."
1,"The item never arrived, and emails to Mowtownusa went unanswered. Amazon canceled my order after a month. Don't waste your time with this company"
2,"Mrs. Kinard presents an excellent medium for the history of African hair. Not only does she provide extensive background knowledge on the scientific aspect of black hair but she also provides styles, steps to maintaining your natural hair and encouragement for wearing a natural style.Thank you Mrs. Kinard for your inspiration and insight. This book helped me to decide to wear my hair natural, again. At 24 years old, I have only permed my hair 6 out of my 24 years of existence and now I even regret that!! After reading your book, I decided to wear braids in preparation for locking my beautiful African hair.THANKS AGAIN!!!"
2,What a blessing it was to see Jason and Demarco live in San Antonio. They inspired me beyond belief. Their voices are dynamic and both have a wide vocal range. The music is filled with the holy spirit. I am sure it will be a blessing to you and if your in a relationship it will offer you hope and the will to love without limits! Beautiful!
2,"To bad Sony doesn't make available the 'Sony VAIO GRV670',really nice machine,was made to compete with the regular 'Desktop'. The 'GRV670' is like a 'German Panzer Tank',just rolls right through any 3-D game like 'Shogun: Total War' and 'Medieval: Total War'. Was thinking about a 'Dell' or 'Gateway',but heard the negative reviews,and stuck to 'Sony',fan is quiet,and at worst just gets warm,where as other 'laptops' get hot like a skillet,fry bacon and eggs. Have loaded both 'Shogun: Total War' and 'Medieval: Total War' games on 'Sony VAIO GRV670',works like a charm. I got this 'Sony Vaio GRV670' to do one thing,play 'shogun' and 'medieval',it performs 101%,no crashing,no freeze-ups,no problems period. I'm happy,and completely satisfied,thank you 'Sony'........"
2,"I looked quite a while for a square footed cake plate. I normally do not order online, but since this was something I wanted I decided to take a chance. After I placed my order the cake plate came in 3 days...really quickly. I opened the box and the first one I received was completely shattered! I was disappointed, however I went online, went throught the very easy return process (not having to pay shipping or anything for the return item) and within another 3 days I had the new cake plate! I could not believe how easy the return process with amazon was. And to say a bit about the cake plate itself. It is very heavy and solid crystal. It is beautiful."
2,"I actually loved this massager, until is stopped working a little over a a week ago. Do you know if I can send this product back? I would love to have one that works. I ordered it on 3/4/08 and it worked for about 3 weeks and then one day I went to turn it on and it just didn't work.*** Update... I emailed the company I bought this from (Chamba). They immediately sent me another one, within 2 days (UPS). I am so happy with this massage. It's built very sturdy! It really helps my fibromyalgia muscles!!"
1,"HORRIBLE GUN.. Breaks easily, doesnt fire and I sent it back to get it fixed and it cost $45...BUT THEY DIDNT FIX IT! it barely fires now, about every 10 times i pull the trigger it fires. and where you put the battery it broke so I have nowhere to put the battery now. DO NOT BUY!!!"
1,"When we set up the screen house for the first time, one of the legs didn't work properly. The button inside the leg that pops out to click into the safety catch was bent, and would not release. We fished it out and made a small field repair on it and got it to work OK. Then, when we were taking down the structure, one of the metal braces that scissor between the legs forming the sides to the house broke into two pieces. We ended up sending it back. Frustrated and disappointed."
2,I purchased an easel for my granddaughter for Christmas. I also purchased pads of easel paper and the deluxe companion easel set from Melissa & Doug. The purchases arrived in speedy time and were overpackaged so there was no need to worry about anything breaking. The paper and art supplies arrived just as advertised. I am so happy that I bought the companion set. My granddaughter was able to use her easel immediately rather than running to the store for crayons & paint & brushes. There's much less mess because each paint brush has a cup with matching color lid. My daughter-in-law says it was an excellent purchase!
2,Very satisfied and pleased with the alacrity this product was shipped. The price was excellent compared with other site offerings......
1,"This is a book ABOUT snow and ice, and everywhere the snowflake illustrations have four- and eight-pointed flakes. (Snowflake crystals are always 6-pointed, or based on a 6-point structure - never 4 or 8.) Maybe kids don't care, but it shouldn't have taken too much to get that right! Colorful illustrations, and the kids like it, but I'm not impressed."
1,"I was quite disappointed with this video. It appeared to be a rather 'amateur' production with poor cues and instructions. The instructor appears to have difficulty talking since she's out of breath. I guess, I was expecting a higher standard like the belly dancing videos that are available. I enjoy bhangra music and have some concept of dancing to it so I found the moves boring and not quite to my expectations. I would skip this one even though I think the concept is great if someone could come up with a better production."
1,Do not buy this book. The questions are way too easy and will prepare you little for the boards. Better to place you money in another review book.
2,"I bought this book for my granddaughter's 6th birthday. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it myself, first. Then I noticed, at the birthday party, each of the adults and older children really took an interest in the book, reading most of it. It's a treasure."
1,"Had the book been less about her husband and more about her (who is, supposedly, the subject of the book), it might have helped. However, the book's overwhelming liability is the fact that it's obviously written by a press secretary. Try as one might, one can't curl up with a good press release. Noor is still young and her life will undoubtedly yield another memoir; let's hope that this one will be written by a voice more like hers."
1,"Didn't Work. Disk Unavailable on desktop, No? Really? That's what the problem that this program was supposed to fix.If i were you u, take it to a professional."
1,"Capitol released a fairly representative Badfinger greatest hits package, although later Warner Bros. releases were not included at the time, a few years back. Now the savvy Captiol folks have released yet another greatest hits package that covers all the well worn hits released a few years back with some Warner Bors. cuts to complete the histroy of the band. Captiol really dropped the ball by not adding some previously unrealesed tracks from Badfinger or The Ivey's. ..."
1,"I have read about Charlotte and Maximillian as peripheral figures in many other books and was looking forward to a book about them alone. Boy, was I disappointed. This is a fan letter to the royal couple, who in all other accounts were spoiled and difficult. There are no photos or other illustrations, no genealogical tables to help sort out the relatives, and worst of all, no index, footnotes, or references. A high school student could do a better job. I am still not entirely sure if this is fiction or non fiction, the author seems to operate half on conjecture and the other on wishful thinking!"
2,"I just wanted to say that I enjoy this album, it represents the seventies for me, in that it is the music that we all listened to in school or out."
2,"For what it is, it's perfect! Every kitchen and emergency supply kit should have a manual can opener. The old kind, without all the ergonomics and padding, were uncomfortable to use; this one's a breeze. It arrived within 10 days of ordering, and is exactly as advertised."
2,"My ugly surfboard (longboard) consumes too much floor space in my apartment's closet (which has a vaulted ceiling because it is under my neighbors staircase). I used the straps to hang my board on the wall unconventionally, not as directed. I slipped the lower strap between the fins and with a little modification of the higher strap using GORILLA brand double-sided tape and an electrical clamp, the nose strap holds perfectly. I found its hold to be very sturdy even when bumped, pulled on, and having an unbracketed bookshelf fall into it.NOTE: My apartment has very weak walls so I didn't use the screws that came with the product. Gorilla double-sided tape and thicker screws did the trick."
1,"This box set is a blatant commercial release by the record company and an embarrasment to the Buffalo Springfield. Yes, the set contains some great songs, but any casual fan who already has the Springfield's ""Retrospective"" album, would be wasting money on this mess. As has already been mentioned by other reviewers, it would be better and more cost effective to purchase the Springfield's first four albums."
1,"Whoa, $10 for the Titanic DVD, what a bargain. HA!! As others have said, it is sorely lacking. Just the movie, no extras. And to add insult to injury the format is widescreen _letterbox_. I watch DVD's on my laptop and this is torture. All the beautiful scenery in this movie squeezed down to almost nothing. What were the publishers thinking??? I truly hope they will re-issue this in fullscreen and with the extras that most other DVD's have especially this incredible production. <rant mode off>"
1,"The motor quit working! I purchased this swing in February and it quit working just yesterday. I called Fisher-Price and I guess I am not the only person with this problem. On the highest swing speed, it failed to move my 14 pound baby (the maximum weight limit is 25 pounds!). The motor was progressively getting louder before it quit working. I have since purchased the 'Ocean Wonders' swing. Personally, I feel that the 'Ocean Wonders' swing is a better choice. It gives you more room below for storage. It is also more colorful and provides more to entertain baby. (Not to mention it's nearly $20 cheaper!) Overall, I would not recommend this product, especially if your baby is dependent on a swing."
2,"It worked well, while it lasted, with in 3-4 months one of the speakers stopped working.no very durable."
2,"If HDMI isn't an option, component is the next best option. These cables provide great quality display from the Xbox. Highly recommended at this price."
2,"My only complain was the waiting on the elevators. The NXE Game install kinda got rid of that but it was too late for me I was nearly done with the game already.Its a great game though, pick it up if you can."
1,"I'm using the 15% - my dentist dropped me down to 15 from 20 because I went back after the first night with stabbing pain in one of my teeth. Stabbing has not gone away (it's weird, I wear the trays overnight and am awakened by a stab around 7 or 8 am.) It recurs somewhat during the day randomly, and is also bad when the teeth are exposed to cold. I would stop using it, but my teeth are not whitening evenly - only the bottoms (part near the gumline is darker.)I skipped a night after doing it 2 nights in a row, but tried it again last night and this morning - STAB. (That was after taking 1/2 a Vicodin as a precaution, last night.)This is NOT WORTH IT. I have had 2 stabbing pains in the time it took me to write this."
1,"i got these knives for christmas, and they are great knives, sharp, balanced. but ive practiced for hours and hours and its very hard to get them to stick in the wood. ive gotten cut 5 times already, and 2 of those times was when it bounced off the wood board and came back and hit me. so bottom line, great knives if you know what you're doing, otherwise they suck. pretty dangerous if you aren't careful. which i wasn't."
1,"I bought this for my parents for Christmas. It doesn't work at all. The dvd drawer won't open. It won't play a VCR tape. I have yet to find out if Amazon or the ""Close out King"" will replace it or refund my money."
1,"I can't stand Shane West as Michael, he was completely miscast for this show. He just seem for me like a really bad actor. I won't pay a penny to see him acting at all. I don't know why they didn't bring back the creator of the LFN the same one that did 24 hours. Maggie looks so fragile that she can break just trying to hit somebody. I like fantasy, but she is way to much, I can't believe her performance at all. And no, real La Femme Nikita fans don't like this show, we hate it."
2,"Excellent, clean, movie with great depth. I saw the movie in the theaters, and I took my 9 years old son...but he was bored out of his mind after 30 minutes, so I wouldn't suggest taking a youngster who isn't really into this type of film."
2,"I just finished this book, laughing and crying. I've had five brain surgeries and I wish I could make this book assigned reading for all the people (doctors included) who got me through it, as well as the small handful that couldn't deal with the inevitable damage and changes, and are no longer in my life.I loved everything about this book - its honesty and resilience - and agree that humor is the only way to deal with things that are not funny. Thank you Suzy!"
1,"When you are in the store and you see this software... IGNORE IT! It is so limited. The box says you can draw a 3D object, but that object turns out to be a wall about one inch thick. Also, it does not allow you to layer the things you draw. The only semi-cool thing you can do is create a mickey mouse that has no eyes or fingers. This product is really for kids at the age of six or below. So if you go out thinking that you are getting a good deal for 3D animation/drawing tools, you are way off. All in all, on a scale from one to five, I give it a negative five, but that was not a choice in the ratings so I had to pick one. So in conclusion, IT STINKS LIKE ROTTON EGGS!"
2,The item was as pictured and delivered in a reasonable amount of time. I like purchasing from Amazon. Find them reliable and easy to deal with.
2,"This small rhyming book is irresistable. Rhyming text paired with colorful illustrations show situations my sons are familiar with: tandem nursing and nursing in a bath. Unique, important and fun!"
2,"Amazing color! Goes beautifully with the ""chili"" red and the ""cumin"" orange. Many decor possibilities- modern, Spanish, Mediterranean, etc. Just a bit disappointed that Corelle does not offer its lifetime warranty- only a year on the stoneware. Nice weight and, so far, unbroken. Affordable set of dishes, and a great deal for the price."
2,"I was constantly cleaning duck and seagull messes off my docks and swim platforms. Since getting the Gullsweep, I don't have any more problems. They mount easily, move in the slightest breeze and are easy to move out of the way when we want to use the space."
2,"I have had a Table Mate II for a few years now. I decided to order a second one so that I can use one to eat on and one for my laptop. The new one I just ordered is identical to the original one I have had for years. It was in perfect shape and went together in about 30 seconds. I have seen some reviews where people said this wasn't an actual Table Mate II and didn't have the Table Mate II logo on the tray. Mine does. I wonder if they ordered it from a different page or something. The only difference between my old one and my new one is that the new one has a slide out ""cup holder"" on the right side. It isn't very sturdy and therefore I wouldn't put a drink in it, but I find it very handy for paper clips, binder clips and other things in when I am working. Overall I am very pleased with the product and would order again if something were to happen to my old one."
1,This is the worst CD I ever bought.I only bought it for one song and well thats all I pretty much got.I turned around and sold it back to Poco's so they could try and re-sell it used (once). What a waste of money. Blahhh
2,"Well there is no mistaking diana has some real talent & impressive stage presence, I mean how old is this young girl.She has only just begun.This cd is fine ,although I think more songs written like emotional would bring out her best. The way she brings this song down to a gentle 'head voice' is just beautiful.That right there shows control & maturity in her voice. I think because of her leann rimes tone at times she would do quite well with a real ballady country album instead of this cd although it's ok , she could really show off her voice & nice range. Maybe a remake of 'Blue'. Wow that would be incredible or even 'crazy' she would be amazing singing one of those.Look forward to future recordings of this ""Gem""."
1,"I too was a HUGE Faith Hill fan and loved her to death. I have every one of her albums and have to say this is the most disappointing album I have ever bought. Faith took country to the big city and made it mainstream. She became a cover girl, movie star, a high class chic. Trying to sell me on Mississippi Girl is a laugh. Her dancing in torn jeans, a shirt trying to say she's still the same old girl and trying to imitate every Gretchen Wilson move is embarrassing. I might be convinced if she were not living in her California mansion, jet setting around the world and flaunting huge diamonds, but sorry - no sell. It doesn't wash. You are not the same old country girl. Everything is NOT AOK in the USA because this album stinks the place up. Sorry Faith - try again - give us another Breathe and we'll forgive you."
2,I found this book very easy to understand. And it gives very practical and real work scenarios of where you can apply the modeling techniques of UML.
1,"The watering balls did not work at all for me. I tried them in several different pots with no luck. The only time my plants were watered is when I lifted the balls out of the dirt. I had hoped that at least they would be decorations in the pots, put they are very heavy."
1,We got the item 2 weeks later than scheduled date. The base came cracked from top to bottom. We couldn't return it because we'll be losing 2 expenses 15% of shipping and new shipping charges. It's still laying in our house un-assembled because we're looking for a carpenter's fix.
1,Looked fine when I got the package. It was packed well and efficiently with no damage. But when I went to assemble the table I noticed that the bottom piece of the table top was mounted off center so that the notches to hold the table legs were too big or too little. When the notch is too little the top of the leg does not sit flush with the mounted board when screwed together. It would have wobbled eventually if I had not cut two of them larger.
1,This product is mislabeled!!!! It is a STUDY GUIDE not the graphic novel as it claims to be!! I love the Swiss Family Robinson and asked for the graphic novel for Christmas but was extremely disappointed and upset at being misled and receiving this worthless pamphlet (a few sheets of paper stapled together) instead!
2,"As other reviews have noted, this knife looks and feels very light and almost too thin, but is highlyl effective in many small tool applications and is very sharp and easy to clean and store. Great new addition and follow-up to other Victorinox purchases."
2,"This is classic Ian Tyson cowboy fare. This is not Country Western, this is the real deal ""Real Cowboy"" music. I love it! Ian Tyson is at his best when he sings his own compositions!"
1,"Anyone unaware of the fact that the business world is changing and people must change with it, does not belong in business today. Frankly, I found the book simplistic to the point of being insulting."
1,not so good i did not get the scanner which i was hoping was coming with... next time you should let ppl know that there isnt one that comes with it
1,"I got my husband this concert for Christmas. We love watching concerts together and have been to many live shows together. I was shocked by how cheesy this video was - we didn't even watch the whole show because it is so bad. We have seen collective soul live twice and thought they put on a great performance both times. I found this concert to be more of a show for the cameras than it was for the audience - it was totally overdone which ruined the experience of feeling like you are at a live show. My expectations were high for this video since it got such great reviews so i was totally disappointed.We have many great concerts on DVD...I would highly recommend Matchbox Twenty SHOW, Alice in Chains MTV Unplugged, Pink Floyd PULSE, Rob Thomas LIVE at Red Rock (this is my favorite). Like I said, we watch a lot of concerts on DVD and this is my least favorite...boo to Collective Soul for being so cheesy and not being their true selves."
2,"Dirt is another AiC album that is full of hard progressive rock. The album starts off with a hard hitting tune ""Them Bones"" which is written collectively in 6/8 time. The twist of sounds in ""Down In A Hole"" (#4) is absolutely amazing. One minute you have a slow finger-picking ballad to Lance's solo and it picks up to be absolutely harsh in the chorus. ""Rooster"" is a another song that is hardcore Alice in Chains all the way through. ""Would?"" is the song that ends the album. It too is distorted and and is another great song. All in all, this isthe AiC album with the most top hits. So if you have never bought an AiC album before, this would be the one to start with."
2,"I loved Mistress because it portrays the ""behind the scenes"" of what producing a movie is truly about. I loved Sheryl Lee Ralph in this movie because it portrays what just be me going on in our movie industry. Sheryl is an excellent actress and need to be seen in more excellent movies. Excellent producing/directing on DeNiro's part."
2,"Valery Gergiev and the Kirov Orchestra yield a magnificient performance of Stravinsky's ""Rite of Spring"" that emphasizes the raw, barbaric quality of the score. This is by far the most dynamic recording I've heard of this work, pulsating with much raw, emotional energy. Gergiev leads his forces in a series of sonic explosions from the woodwinds, brass and percussion. As for the Scriabin, it is an interesting choice highlighting the young Stravinsky's musical ties to the older Russian composer; this performance seems far more restrained, and slightly less compelling than a Carnegie Hall performance of this work that I heard earlier this year with Gergiev conducting the Kirov Orchestra. Still, this CD is worth acquiring just for Gergiev's dynamic interpretation of Stravinsky."
1,"When I got this hat it looked different then the picture on Amazon.the color was more fadded and the ""S"" was bigger and made it look childish.the fit was off also. I like my hats to fit around my head, not sit on top of it."
2,"I have listened to this CD with my brother and we both cry like babies when we hear Testify..... No matter where I am or what I am doing, I make time to watch my favorite program of all time, ""Touched By An Angel"""
1,I don't remember ever seeing my nephews play with this toy.I'm sure I didn't pay much for it but the excitement for this toy didn't last too long after the initial opening on Christmas eve.
2,"This is an excellent book for all levels of Turkey hunters.It is very informative and covers all aspects of Turkeyhunting. The author knows what he is talking about and heexplains in depth how to call,when to call, where to callfrom,and how to react to every possible situation you willencounter in Turkey hunting.I recommend this book to whoeverhas hunted or has thought about hunting the american WildTurkey."
2,"Never saw Rammstein in whole concert before- only thier videos and one live concert clip where they did some pretty crazy things so i was suprised when i saw this- it was more toned down than i was expecting but still pretty cool with thier flame throwers and pyrotechnics. I dont speak or know that much german but even though i dont know everthing they are saying it still rocked. Heres a review of the songs.1.Speil mit fir-4.2 stars out of 52.Herzeleid-4 out of 53.Bestrafe mich-3.9 out of 54.Weiss Fleisch-4 stars5.Sehnsucht- 4 stars6.Asche zu asche-3.5 stars7.wilder wein- 3 stars8.klavier- 4 stars9.heirate mich-3.5 stars10.du reichst so gut-3 stars11.Du hast- 5 stars/awesome song12.Engel- 4 stars13.Rammstein-4.5 stars14.tier-3.5 stars15.laichzeit- 4 stars16.wollt ihr das bet in flammen sehen?3.5 stars17.seeman-4 starsOverall 4 out of 5 star dvd including sound , picture, songs and concert. Recomended for any rammstein fan or fan of metal."
2,Very funny! Great light reading. Narrator has great humor and the characters are nicely sketched. Recommended for those that like British comedy.
2,I bought this looking for a way to connect 3 toslink components into one toslink input connector on my stereo and this fits the bill.It works as described and does a good job at it. Is built pretty solid too.I would have given it 5 stars but the remote only works if you stand within a foot from it.In that case I just go ahead and push the select buttons on front myself.Not a big problem but would be nice if the remote worked since it is part of the whole deal.
2,"This is a dope album like Killah Priest and Sadat X's first joints that is misunderstood and certified wood instead of gold. In hiphop in this era that happens to so much creative music. The rhyme style is unique and indivualistic as it should be, a project influenced neo-realism if you will. I don't give@... and Smoke are the choice tracks. Young Love is a well told story as well, this is one of the best albums of 2000."
2,"After considerable research, I bought this vacuum and I LOVE it. As incredible as it sounds, when I vacuumed my living room with this vacuum -- I COULDN'T BELIEVE the difference -- my rug looks revitalized and clean! After cleaning the room, there was so much cat and dog hair, I had to empty the bin..... That was easier than replacing/throwing out a bag by far..This purple vacuum practically purrs when you use it - it's very quiet. The only negative is the ""manually"" wound up cord. I'll gladly live with the cord ........."
1,This book is not on par to the first two in the trilogy. It amost feels as if a different author penned it....its ponderous and slow. The few interesting plot elements are glossed over for detailed description of the countrysde and scenery.
2,I ordered this as a gift because of the price. I could see why cause its plastic basically. The child had a good time with it and we didnt expect it to last long so it served the purpose.
1,"Fight Songs really disappointed me. I first bought ""Too Far to Care,"" and that cd is a masterpiece; definitely one of my all favorites. ""Fight Songs"" is a big step down from their previous three cds."
1,"Granted, this thing was made at least four decades ago, and I'm sure they thought it was really risque at the time. But today it's just BORING. There's some implied girl-girl attraction, but nothing ever materializes. I applaud the people in marketing for putting that picture on the box, because they succeeded in luring me into purchasing a videotape I NEVER would have bought had I seen it first!"
2,The video is exactly like Sesame Street in english the program is great for introducing new vocabulary and understanding the words in Spanish. I bought this for my five year old son. Although I recommend getting the alphabet because knowing the sounds of each letter is important in Spanish pronuncation.
1,"Please ignore the title.Green Day had two good albums:""1039 / Smoothed Out Slappy Hours""and ""Kerplunk.""The others were decent, but not something I would really ever listen to. This is complete trash. Billy Joe spouts off about how much he hates corporate America, and then I turn on MTV and there he is, either being interviewed or playing on a video. The album, supposedly, is an attack on the state of America, yet, from what I see, the ones listening are the rich teeny boppers who used mommy and daddy's money to buy this trash.The lyrics on ""American Idiot"" are vague and uninteresting, especially on the hit single ""Blvd. of Broken Dreams."" The music itself is the same Green Day music we've been hearing for ten years. Come on, boys, do something new.If this is political punk than Celine Dion is early DC hardcore. Listen to Bad Brains, Agnostic Front, or Fugazi."
1,This game purports to work on Mac and Windows. It did neither. My Windows 7 is too new for it and my Mac Leopard X I guess is too new also. It would not load onto either platform. And that is a shame because I really appreciate the game.
1,"The corset itself looks amazing, Unfortunately it was too small. When I asked to return the product not even 2 days after I received it, I was told no. This company is extremely unreasonable considering that we are purchasing over the internet, it's not like we were at a store where we would be able to try it on before we purchased the item. I have never come across such a situation, as a matter of fact, at the same time I purchased this corset I purchased another one, but that one was too big. I got in contact with the company and was able to return the item.I'm extremely disappointed and aggravated with the company."
2,It helps to use the system for people that do not play games on the PS3 because all the buttons are like a standard blue-ray/dvd player. Easy to link up (1 minute) and batteries last a long time.
1,"Seriously, all these 5-star reviews are fake. Hell, anything above 2 stars is fake. Mr Hines and his amateur crew of psedo-fimlmakers just want you to believe this is acctualy worth buying (for some reason, Mr Hines is unable to accept his movie as being bad, very bad). If only the same effort was made while producing this atrocity.Please everyone, dont believe in these fake reviews, and please stay away from this film. Save you money.btw this is to Mr Hines: YOUR MOVIE IS CRAP!DEAL WITH IT!and claiming Anthony Piana with his plastic mustache is the next Al Pacino is a offence to the former."
2,"WOW!! I had heard how good this movie is, but didn't realize it was that good. We saw the DVD for the first time over the weekend during a dinner party at a neighbor's house. We were all very impressed with the tremendous struggle that Charles had to maintain, with the discrimmination, especially in the south. Even some Afro-Americans were taking advantage of this blind black man. Not only was he a musical genius, but also a survivor!I found it troubling how much Charles got caught in spider webs of drug abuse and unethical women, bound to get a hold of some of his fortune. I was surprised that he had 12 children, many out of wedlock? All an all, his life was success, because of the joy of music he brought to millions and millions around the globe. I will never forget how Charles could deliver the song ""America""...how he could make me shed a tear every time he sang that great song.I hope this film wins many awards. It deserves a lot of praise!"
2,Good purchase for measuring small amounts of strong herbs or spices. Would be better if marked by fraction of teaspoon. Luckily Amazon reviewer had this info available so I could engrave mini-spoons.
1,"As I began this book I had hoped to get information about the causes, treatments and dietary advice for someone diagnosed with hypoglycemia. I was disappointed that this was not the information I felt the book delivered. The book failed the reader in explaining hypoglycemia. It provided alot of antecdotal evidence to support its claims. In addition much of its advice was undoable by the average person - it included suggestions to use only full spectrum light, avoid the use of microwave ovens, eat only fertile eggs and drink only raw milk. I am eager to control my hypoglycemia but couldn't help but wonder at the validity of much of this advice."
1,Thus is the mist repulsive stupidest movie ever produced. I watched 20 minutes and shut it off. To view this as funny only inducates serious lack of intelligience. Beavis and butthead wiuld laygh rhats about it.
2,"Cd was like the seller said a few light surface scratches. played great, and I ran two cleaning cycles via my disk cleaner machine. Plays like a champ, and even ran five copies for friends and they all sound excellent."
2,"Beside being a surprising disturbing movie with some really creepy shot of Asbury Park NJ, Animal Room contains a great scene by the legendary horror punk band the Misfits. The song played is actually the Kryst the Conqueror recording of Dr. Phibes Rises Again (the vocals are lip synched by Michale Graves). The band is a wonderful addition to an already great movie that should be loved by anyone lucky enough to have come across it."
1,"Why isn't there a 1/2 star rating available? Shouldn't the production of some CDs be declared an environmental hazard, if only because of the not so ""beautiful noise"" pollution? Seriously, Neil, thanks, but I don't think so."
1,"This wasn't a movie, this was 88 minutes of wasted time. I cant believe the amount of positive reviews this got, unbelievable. John Hughes & this thing should never be in the same sentence. Comparing John's work to Nima Nourizadeh is disrespectful and disgraceful to J.Hughes fans throughout. Warner Bros. should be embarrassed for releasing this stuff under their name. Blind buyers beware, rent first! It wouldn't surprise me to see this in the $1 bin very soon, and even then, it's overpriced."
1,"I watched the companion DVD ""Unlocking the Mysteries of Life,"" first, and found it very enlightening. So much so that I was compelled to order Icons of Evolution."" Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. I have a hunger for knowledge on the subject of Intelligent Design, and ""Mysteries"" fed that hunger. ""Icons"" did not. It played out like an unbiased but detailed news article where both sides were allowed to sling mud at each other. I've seen enough news articles on the subject, even written one myself for the local newspaper. I understand the controversy, and I don't want to hear about it over and over. I am interested in the science behind ID and Darwinian Evolution.In all fairness, the DVD does live up to its title, if not the hopes inspired by the companion video. :)"
2,I highly recommend Dandelion Moisturizer for normal/dry skin. It goes in quickly without any oiliness. I wouldn't use anything else.
1,"This is the worst product on the market. I have a much cheaper Holmes and it has lasted me three years so far. This is my sencond one in less than two years. The first one's motor gave out within a few months and was replaced by the company. The second one started leaking almost immediately and I found my sons wooden dresses destroyed one morning because all the water leaked out. Also it is so noisy, not a nice calm noise but an mechanical noise that let a blower sound good. I will never buy anything from them again and would rather just buy filters."
1,No where on the description did it say 1 pair. I should have at least got 2 pair of socks in this order for this price. I am disappointed. Now I have to buy other socks to make up for this 1 in the present.
1,"I like the fabric, nice and smooth and flexible, but, the velcro straps are not sewn on very well. The first windy day one of the straps tore loose from the cover. I have a commercial sewing machine, so, I sewed it back on, and re-sewed all the other ones on better. The next windy day, the strap tore completely off. If you live in an area with lots of wind, be leery of this cover. Also, since it's sold by Amazon, you can't get in touch with the manufacturer."
1,"When I went looking for a wall clock to replace one that had broken, the Atomic feature and the low price both caught my eye. When it was delivered I was excited about setting it up and trying it out. As soon a I put the battery in it was apparent that, as the clock was attempting to set itself, the minute hand was hanging up on the second hand. The first attempt did not set the clock to the local time, so I took the battery out and tried again. Same result except that this time the minute hand spun the second hand completely off leaving the second hand laying encased at the bottom of the clock. Needless to say I sent the clock back."
2,"I was very happy with this book. It is longer than I thought it would be, and more sturdy. Plus all of the pictures are very cute and very well labeled, without being too busy."
1,"IF you like movies with lots and lots of scenes of people getting shot in half and heads and arms blown off and extremely close up shots of blood guts and gore then you'll like this movie.OR if you liked the original First blood with the smart Rambo and intelligent plot with action then you'll hate this.The movie is supposed to deal with the subject of genocide. It deals with the subject by showing you scene after scene after scene after scene of people being butchered with very video game style special effects.Of your a fan of David Morrell's character, you'll hate this movie. This movie has nothing to do with him."
1,"Like the other reviewer, Robert Dinger, I have really enjoyed Sam Llewellyn. I am also a great fan of Alistair MacLean's earlier works. If you expect a winning combination in THUNDERBOLT FROM NAVARONE, though, you will be sorely disappointed. The story was not captivating, the characters were not interesting. The cliff-hangers were paraded past like a sad Indiana Jones wanna-be. This is no successor for Alistair MacLean. Again, Sam Llewellyn's yacht racing mysteries are very enjoyable, especially if you're a Dick Francis fan, and I am looking forward to the next one of those."
2,"The people in Kigali, Rwanda are lovin' Carl Thomas' CD...Thanks for turning these brothers into 'I WISH' kind of men..."
1,"It was advertise ""like new"" Yea right, most of the button are completely erased and you cannot guess what they are for. but it was cheap and I was too cheap to pay $10 more to get a new one. My mistake."
1,"This book is a solid 2 stars. Mildly amusing and no more. I can recall one laugh-out-loud moment. Frankly, I've been starved for a really good book. I picked up four from the library, based on reviews I've read here. I hope one or two of the others are better. I hate wasting my valuable reading time on such mediocre material.The theme of this book is ""poor me"" by a self-absorbed rich kid who was given everything in the world, and had a few upsetting moments, with which she filled this book. Save time and read the inside jacket cover only - all the best material is there, and there isn't any more. You can be done with it in 5 minutes."
1,Page after page is exactly the same. There is no variety or plot. I rarely do not finish books but I am going to put this one down.
2,Great show. Wish I had their money - nice to pretend its me... Regardless great season! Highly recommend this one
2,"This collar works well, but runs through batteries quickly. It stopped the barking though - so I guess it does it's job!"
2,This book was ordered for my son inlaw because he had started reading the author and like the way he wrote so I found more for him.
1,"The plot has way too many unnecessary characters. The title is interesting and relevant, but I objected to there not being ramifications for the characters actions. While I have been a huge fan of Dymmoch's Calab/Thinnes series, I was very disappointed in this book."
1,"Is this book going to deal with Richard and Kahlan's child? Or with the Imperial Order?Or neither,or both"
1,"Iomega disks have to be the worst form of storage media ever created. They are easily corruptable. I can't tell you the number of disks I've had to throw away because they have died on me. They've destroyed projects that I've saved on them. Projects that were unretrievable because all of a sudden the disk cannot be read by the computer or even worse freezes the computer.On top of all this, Iomega disks are way too expensive for being such a bad product. I even had to ask an Iomega technician what I was doing wrong. After going over possible scenerios of what I've might of done, we both concluded it wasn't me but indeed there was something wrong with the disks.My advice is to stay away from Iomega disks and all other Iomega products and go with CD-RW disks of any brand. They store more info, are much cheaper and are much more reliable."
1,"If you are looking for a book that really teaches how to minister to or instruct the heart of a child, as a parent, or teacher or guardian.... the book I would strongly recommend in place of this one is ""Connection Parenting: Parenting Through Connection Instead of Coercion. Through Love Instead of Fear."" The book is absolutely phenomenal!! And unlike this book it not only leaves the child with his/her dignity in tact, by treating them with the same respect that God treats us with, but teaches the parent exactly how to form a very healthy intimate and mutually respectful bond (which yields to obedience by the way) that will last a lifetime between parent and child. Invaluable tools! Don't waste your money on Ms. Plowmans book. Children are too precious to hurt. There is a much better way, and your child will become a stronger, more self confident, happier individual...FOR LIFE !!"
2,I really enjoyed the The Shipping News although I found much of the sentence structure to be slightly difficult to read. The wonderful descriptions and characters made up for that. It was like a return to the past for me--having lived in Newfoundland for 2 years in the 1960's. I can hardly wait for the movie version!
2,The smell alone of fresh brewed coffee is enough reason to purchase this coffee pot. The taste simply clinches it.
2,"Robert Allen discusses the challenges of the ""new economy"" and provides sound principles toward achieving financial security. Having been a ""Nothing Down"" student, I've again been blessed by a master financial planner. Get this book, you won't be sorry."
2,"I've been looking for this book since it was first in The Mail-Order Cat and am so happy to have found it! the recipes DO brighten my cat's life and MINE TOO!!!I have friends who will be happy this book is found too! One of them has a gift store in Colorado and used to order this book all the time!"""
2,"Just got back from a 1600 mile road trip with 5 bikes in the rack hanging out the hitch of my wife's XC90. My bike is the only one of the five that fit perfect, two of the bikes were my wife's and my daughter's and two were my sons' all of which did not have a cross bar to sit over the rack's two bars in a ""pretty"" manner. With some patience and wiggling all five bikes fit and were strapped snug over the rack. It held really well even through the hills and mountains of northern Georgia. The bikes come off easily and we were able to unload. The only problem is that if the rack is fully loaded with five bikes you better have a good reason to get into the back of your SUV because it takes three people to gently let the rack down and to put it back up."
1,"To each his/her own. I was suckered into buying a case on a Friday sale. I'm now still trying to give them away a package at a time. (You want one???) They are blended, pureed, formed into peapods, but NOT any remote resemblance of an actual green bean. I hate them (although one of my sister-in-laws and parents have ordered 3 more cases). Like I said--to each his/her own. I personally hate them."
1,"I feel these headphones are advertised incorrectly. How can you add the word ""audiophile"" to these headphones? The headphones are subpar at best. The mid-range is flat and the bass is non-existent. I own the Sennheiser HD202 that cost me $25 and they sound excessively better than these headphones($50). I cannot recommend these headphones and have a clear conscience. Try Sennheiser HD 202, you will not be disappointed."
1,"The right wing fans of Ms. Coulter seem to be busy bees trying to defend this barely readable book. (I bought it out of sincere interest, and continued to plow through the nonsense considering it as a comedy script). Now, you could dismiss me as 1. a ""left wing nut"" which I am not, or 2. the biased ""liberal"" ( always Ms. Coulters explanation when the truth hurts) or 3. ""never read the book"" (untrue)... but in the end, the reality stands: this book is quite boring. I read it throught to the end rather quickly, trying to understand what her point was in writing such a laughable book...but in these conservative times, ANYONE can write a book slaming so-called liberals and make money. Don't make the same mistake I did in thinking you would get a reasoned ""Pat Buchanan"" intellectual argument ( even though I tend to disagree with him). With Ms. Coulter, we are dealing with a ""lightweight"". Be forewarned...don't waste money on this one."
1,"Fans of Simple Things should not blindly drop their hard-earned cash on this CD before listening to a sample. Or better yet, read the small print on the back. This is a compilation CD with only one track by Zero 7. One track! Yet the cover leads you to believe the entire CD is Zero 7 and that we should expect the same great arrangements that we heard on Simple Things. Not so. I feel I've been had and you will too unless you're fans of Quasimoto, Roots Manuva, Slum Village, Cinematic Orchestra, Joy Zipper, Souls of Mischief, and other of bands that just roll off your tongue like Da Lata, Sylvia Striplin, Leroy Hudson, etc. Next time I'll read the fine print. Caveat emptor."
1,"""Chandler"" is a film with a terrific cast - Warren Oates, Charles McGraw, Gloria Grahame, Royal Dano, Scatman Crothers, Richard Loo, Mitch Ryan - but it never gets off the ground. Director Paul Magwood (1943) complained that MGM re-cut the film and changed the music, but that's only half the problem. The other problem is that the scenes themselves are dull and lackluster, regardless of how you cut them, and regardless of the heavy handed music score that was not uncommon for early 70s action films.BTW - Magwood was married to co-star Leslie Caron. This was Magwood's first film and only film as a director. His later career was built around work on TV as an assistant director for B TV movies and series (""Nero Wolfe"", Mike Hammer"", ""Father Dowling Mysteries"").Those of you, like me, who love Warren Oates films (""The Wild Bunch"", ""Badlands"", ""Ride the High Country"", ""Dillinger"", ""Bring me the Head of Alfredo Garcia"") will be disappointed."
2,gggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhh best game ever made 1st place wait its not yet o then it will be the best game ever.
2,"I was amazed that they decided to release two seasons in one set at the same price as one season. This is an incredible value. The only thing I despise is the fact that they gave us 4:3 ratio for season 2 when it is available in widescreen on other Johnny Test DVDs that are already out (Gametime, Johnny and Dukey, Johnny vs. Bling Bling Boy, Johnny X and Super Pooch). The only season that should be in standard 4:3 is season 1. I have no idea why this was done but with 16:9 TVs being the standard now, it seems to be a waste. Other than that, this is a great set to have if you enjoy the cartoon."
1,"nuclear power sucks. Have you seen the movie ""The china syndrome""? That movie tells the truth. We humans are truly the cancer of the earth and our disregard for this fragile planet shows that we need to go. The development of nuclear power shows our egotism is out of control. This guy hates not just children, but,more importantly, all legitimate life on this planet as well."
2,Wife had read before and wanted to read again and to keep for future reference. She loved the book and may want more of his books later.
2,"i watched the second one first and was marginally dissapointed because it was not as good as the second production. yet, it is still awesome to veiw"
1,It died after one use. I should've just spent more on a better brand. Get the real ones so you don't waste your money.
2,"A truly masterful analysis of ""what is knowledge?"" Wilson persuasively points out what is science, its goals, value, and limitations. It is essential reading for our age of information glut. All people need a filter to manage the myriad of facts, and opinions thrown at us in a daily basis. He points out that the chasm among culture, religion, philosophy, and science is narrowing. He believes that faith will not advance understanding, although there is no denying that this thinking mechanism can give transient comfort. Unfortunately it also extremely destructive. Sigmund Feud is demolished, and rightly so. His analyses provide a framework for better communication. I would love to see the ideas discussed on a broader basis. It should be required reading for all professional communicators."
2,"What's with all you arrogant, ""it's not as good as the real thing"" people?"" Somehow I doubt Emmylou Harris had any intention to duplicate, or improve upon, Gram Parson's original sound. I never saw Parsons perform live, and I don't care. I've always loved listening to his music, and this compilation does nothing to disappoint. Anyone who comes to this disc with an open mind, enough mental flexibility to accept alternate performances of old standards, and a plain old appreciation for Parsons-style country rock will love this recording. If it titillates enough to send people back to the GP section for original recordings, so much the better. But this collection holds up quite well as an entity unto itself."
1,We were happy to finally find a gate that fits the irregular opening at the top of our stairs for such a great price. The gate installed quickly and everything seemed great until we tried to open the latch. There is nothing easy about this latch and even my husband--who is a pro with anything even slightly mechanical--had trouble and agreed the value of the gate wasn't worth the fight we had to go through to open it. We had to press down on the tiny square latch release with all our might and then wiggle the gate until it popped off the mounting! I couldn't imagine trying to open the gate while holding a baby!
1,"a perfect circle is far from a perfect listening pleasure. the first six tracks are excellent and a far cry from tool (which is a good thing), except judith. the last six tracks sound like tool songs that didn't make the final cut for their albums. keenan and the gang show they know how to write melodramatic music that feels incomplete after the songs end. if you're a tool fan you most likely will enjoy this, if you're not maybe you'll like one or two tracks."
2,"Easy to assemble and looks wonderful. Black with silver accents, it enhances the look of either a black or silver TV set. Lots of room underneath for game systems and peripherals."
1,"I bought 6 of these from a local merchant with the expectation they would outlast a standard 9v Alkaline. Three of them have already failed in less than 2-years. The worst part... ALL 3 of them died in the middle of the night!! Nothing like getting out the ladder at 2am to pull a battery just to get the smoke detector to stop announcing ""Low Battery"". This past weekend I replaced all 6 with Alkalines. The best part... an 8-pack of name brand 9v on sale cost less than the price of just one of these."
2,The movie is hilarious and the cast is awesome. Probably one of John Cusacks best movies.
1,"There are very few funny scenes. It's completely nonsense. For example, there are scenes with American Idol's judges commenting the Spartans. After 30 minutes, the jokes dried up. Then, it's become very boring.It's still better than Scary movie 3 and Date movie."
2,"A very good resource, Robert Wade is a masterful watercolorist, he covers all the aspects of producing a good water colour painting"
2,"has always been a great record and remains so as a cd---also the ""price is right""!Will make a great gift to a blues collector"
1,"I expected Ted to be funny. I got bored half way through and did not watch the movie to the end. I found this movie annoying, in your face and unsubtle. From the excessive dope smoking, swearing, crudeness, immaturity, self absorbance, just another Bro-mance tween movie....a lazy movie, not witty at all. I like the concept of the movie yet the product is another terrible Hollywood comedy. Shame, Mark Wahlberg has been is some really great movies (The Departed for one and more). This just wasn't one of them."
1,"I started out hoping for some kind of drama, eventually, but the sickening sweetness was unrelenting. Combined with the fact these people had no business owning a large, strong working-breed dog. Gosh, the trouble they got themselves into -- how cute! Still cute. Forever cute. I started to flip through it. Then just flipped to the end. Started disgusted with the owners for one reason, wound up more disgusted for another. If you know anything at all about dogs, do not buy this book."
2,"I believe readers of every faith and race would enjoy thisbook -- as a testiment to the human will and as the fulfillment of anancient biblical prophesy. I would encourage anyone to read this book and be inspired by Shmuel Yilma's family, his people, and the accomplished life he now leads in Israel, leading the way for many to follow.To Mr. Yilma, his family and the wonderful soul who was his grandmother I say, thank you and Shalom!!"
2,"Tom Ricks has produced a gripping tale that is both chilling and totally plausible. He demonstrates, as he did in his previous book ""Making the Corps,"" an expert eye for modern military culture. Ricks doesn't go for the easy cartoon plot twists that are featured in too many books of this genre. He serves up some complex ethical questions. In ""A Soldier's Duty,"" like in real life, the answers aren't always black and white."
1,"I've tried this device on three different computers, and it still says can not find memory card. It loads the drivers but plugging the cards in they do not show up. I have tried a handful of cards from different vendors."
2,This movie was very entertaining. I intend to pursue others by the same producer/director. Very imaginative and thought provoking. Plan to watch it again.
2,"I love Discover magazine. It tells you all the latest science news slightly ""dumbed down"" a bit so that the average person can understand."
1,It it a coincidence that i got serious stomach cramps after listening to this CD. I got the sickies real bad.
2,"The merchandise came very quickly, faster than the estimated time. It also came in excellent condition"
1,"I'm really surprised to see this sequel rated so highly. Although Carpenter penned the screenplay, it was very much lacking from his suspenseful direction.This entry suffers from not enough Jamie Lee Curtis, a different guy playing Michael Meyers(in a different physical-style) and a mish-mashed storyline that barely plods along. All of the killings happen quickly and without any of the buildup of suspense that made the first movie such a classic.Fans of the first will probably want to see this but it's strictly uninspired B-movie material all the way around. I think Esacape from L.A. was a more worthy sequel, and that's not sayin' much..."
1,"Yuck, is all I have to say about this CD. If anyone out there is buying this CD because there's not enough of Steve Wilson's Porcupine Tree to purchase, STOP NOW. Together we're Stranger as a monotonous meandering of very dull music. Don't get me wrong. I am not a rocker who can't tollerate clever ambient music, but this music is so boring I can't believe Wilson would have any part of it. Once again, and this time with vigor, Yuck!"
1,"These valve covers are not as advertised and are of very poor quality. The ""features"" section says they are baffled, but in fact are not. There are noticeable machine marks on the sides, and the chrome plating is poor and not what I expected. I would not recommend these valve covers to anyone."
2,"I just love this book. It's such an easy to read guide and you don't have to read it in order either. I found it rather therapeutic. I don't mean that it'll help you with all of you're problems. However, this is a really great start trying to get a different look into you're self."
1,"I have a Bichon Frise that has been having problems with fleas for a some weeks. We have tried the flea shampoos, the collar, practically everything. I saw online that FRONTLINE was the best product to kill fleas so I decided to buy it, even though it is extremely expensive for the small bottles it has. I put it on my dog, and after 3 days the fleas were back. This product is not worth it at all, it is a waste of money!"
1,Some exercises have no basis in the test. Mask illustrations are not in alignment. The text drifts in spots and makes learning difficult.
2,"The humble W59 is compact, light as a feather, unobtrusive and ultra-comfortable, yet totally functional, good looking, and robust. Its design has endured unchanged for many years. The three-button ergonomics and simple, easy flow and control of functions has been long-perfected. The alarm is loud and the LED illumination works well. It is hard to think of how this watch could be improved. The W59 is quite similar to the world-famous, super basic F-91, but with a 50M water rating and (I think) a slightly more appealing aesthetic.I respect Casio for making these affordable watches so well - it demonstrates the organization's respect for its customers, regardless of how much they choose to pay for a watch. Anyone should be able to make a good watch if given several hundred dollars, right? But to sell something for under $20 bucks that is durable, attractive, accurate, tough, well made, and high quality? Excellent."
1,"You do get what you pay for, I guess. I purchased this speaker when Amazon offered it at the $19.99 Gold box price. I'm very glad I didn't pay more for it. The sound is quite muffled despite repeated adjustments to the treble and bass. It's fine for a travel stereo but the quality is sadly lacking. It is not worth more than what I paid for it certainly. If you're looking for a better quality, light weight speaker system for iPod, I would recommend theJBL On Tour Portable Speaker System ( Black )"
1,The light weight (red) band didn't last a month. It pulled out of the handle. Very poorly made. Search for a better quality power band if you want any sort of real work out.
1,"This rack is barely usable to hang mugs on. The pegs are wobbly and loose and the whole frame is flimsy. As I tried to hang it, the hanging loop bent and fell off. I would not trust any mugs to this rack! I also tried to hammer small brads into the end of the pegs to prevent the mugs from falling off (as I have done with other mug racks) and the pegs splintered and broke. Unless you want broken mugs, do not buy this rack!"
2,Learning anything new takes time especially if you don't have a teacher. I've been teaching myself how to play piano using various online resources (8notes.com & zebrakeys.com)all of which have served as a great base. After spending several hours reviewing this book it clearly connects bits of info and concepts that were seemingly challenging. Mind you I am an absolute beginner with piano (1 month of dedication)yet this has vital breakdowns & explanations for the beginner. Move over Mozart....there's a new composer in town....j/k but the book IS the best one I've found out of all the beginner books.
2,"Lovely, classy glasses that have that fine crystal ""ting"". We feel special every time we use these. The style goes well with almost any wine glass you set next to it. AND we put them in the dishwasher with no problem."
1,"I've been a subscriber almost since the inception. It's a high quality, slick, polished magazine, but I've finally had enough of the ridiculous content. The Nov. 2010 issue was the final eye opener. Examples . . . Page 80 is trying to tell us that wearing an OUTERWEAR VEST over a suit is a positive fashion statement. Then, at the bottom of the same page, they recommend a SCARF with an $870.00 price tag. This reminds me of an old Groucho Marx quote. "" Any club that would have me as a member, I don't want to belong to."" Well . . . any magazine that promotes the above, plus many more absurdities, I choose not to follow. I'll find something else. Maybe Men's Journal ?"
1,"Batteries are not only rated for the product they are compatible with but also their capacity. Some vendors do not list mAh (mili-Amp Hours) of capacity of the battery they are selling. High capacity batteries are more expensive but if this is not advertized, you can't tell and you can't compare.EA"
2,"I find this book fascinating! Months after buying it, I find myself sitting down to look for a recipe to try, and spending hours reading the historical and herbal notes. Never would have expected the best herbal I own to be a beer book! There is also information on the religious practices of early Celts and Norwegians as they relate to the use of herbs, as well as lots of information on the spiritual use of herbs by modern traditional peoples.As for the beers themselves, Buhner takes a relaxed attitude. Indigenous people make beer without fancy equipment, and we can too. What matters most is what tastes good to us--which means we have to do a lot of experimenting! There are lots of recipes to try here, from the Middle Ages up to the present. But the choice is not as wide as it first looks, because not all of the ingredients are easily available. If you get into this, the next book you'll want may be ""The Brewer's Garden."""
2,"This is a fantastic and exciting book, especially if you love and care for animals!"
2,"Sincerely, I didn't expect a surprise like this. I went to the theater expecting to see a typical entertaining film -I see all the Kevin Spacey's-. When I got out I had that taste in my mouth that only leave the really good films.Magnificent interpretations, a solid script, a good direction and -in occasions- a splendid BGM is all you'll encounter in this film. I won't miss it.Or, at least, that's my opinion..."
2,I really prefer just instruments sometimes. I have used this in prayer time for meetings and church. You can use it while people are gathering or dispersing.
1,"I bought this based on other reviews saying what a great family film this is. Hah! The language is foul. The early scenes have teens having beer parties ect. The rotten language is all through this film. The animals are so obviously phony that you'll laugh yourself silly. The acting is awful. The plot is boring. If you're looking for a beautiful outdoor wilderness film,I advise that you keep on looking...elsewhere.A Concerned Christian Mom"
2,"This is a message from PC Guardian.The above review stating this lock can be opened by a Bic Pen is inaccurate.If you have any questions regarding PC Guardian products please do not hesitate to contact us at 1-800-288-8126.Thank you,PC Guardian"
1,"Amazon.com has delayed my shipment four times for this product. I am anxious to get it as it has good reviews, but we're onto about 6 weeks of delays now. I could have already received it had I purchased it at Lowe's or Home Depot.Good drill, but POOR Amazon.com service on this one. I won't ever order tools via Amazon.com again. Amazon.com just can't cut it here."
1,"I am sorry to inform you that your product was not fresh, on inspection of the package I found that the product sent to me was past the expiration date."
1,"The DVD edition of Dune was poor, even if compared to VHS. The video should have been cleaned up, the audio is not Dolby 5.1, and the additional material is superficial. Also, there is no addition of unused footage despite the many versions of the movie Dune available on laserdisk."
2,"Great mouse, comfortably holds your hand, super smooth with or without a pad, and a nice bonus of being able to magnify literally anything added into the software (that's what the red button is for), all though you don't NEED the software, your computer should automatically recognize it as a normal mouse."
2,Have read many of Vince Flynn's books and enjoyed them all. Memorial Day was the last one I read and it certainly did not disappoint. Had a difficult time putting it down. It was a thriller from start to finish.
2,This band is amazing live. The groove and the vibe that they set is radiating in any atmosphere. I strongly recommend seeing this band live.
2,I love this game. Its nice to have a change of maps from the previous Mario Party. I bought an acceptable cartridge form a seller. There were some markings on it but all that mattered to me was that it worked well. It took some wiggling in the Nintendo 64 but it was able to work. It worked as well as all my other Nintendo 64 games do.
1,"Be wary of the bold, alluring Pepto pink color...I was sent a nasty pale pink my elementary studentswear on their Sunday School dresses."
2,"I listened to this CD after breaking up with my Girlfriend .. and guess what?? Those lyrics!! those voices!! Inspiration!! .. I got up and called her .. and played 'All My Life' via telephone .. then apologised(yes, I had done sume cruel stuff!!) and she melted .. I digress .. this CD is a must for EVERYONE!!! ..I gotta get me another copy!!"
1,"I was excited to get this positively rated radar detector for our upcoming roadtrip down to LA. It worked okay but had many false alarms. For the 6 hour drive, the radar detector went off about 30 times on highway mode. Of those, 3 were actual cops already pulling over people or on the other side of the freeway. Unfortunately when I tried for another long road trip a month later, I found out it had died. :( I didn't think things could just die spontaneously like that but to me it was not worth dealing with the company or buying another Whistler product again."
2,"While actually looking for an audio cassette version of the Bible, I came across JuJu's comment. It was pretty clear to me that this poor, sad person just cruises the internet looking for an opportuinity to bash Christianity. Certainly he wasn't really interested in the Bible. Maybe if he or she really tried to understand and allow Jesus Christ in to his or her life, then the need to spend time so worthlessly out of boredom would not be so great and life would be more fulfilling."
2,"Lord Dain is the infamous, diabolical bad-boy...he is the devil himself. His hard-core, unemotional persona has many petrified of him. But all will change when the Lady Jessica enters into his life. There will be that explosive, sizzling hot passion that will have you breathless throughout this fiction! Likewise, Jessica and Dain's constant heated banters and verbal fights are just so sexually arousing; it stimulates the reader to turn the pages that much faster just to see what happens next. This is truly an awe-inspiring, erogenous joining between both characters...amazing adventure just getting to their adoring unity and compassionate happily-ever-after! Brilliant narrative and well-written 19th century historical romance...captivated me throughout the entire novel. Highly recommend!"
2,"Includes all the best songs of the Bay City Rollers. If you are a fan, you will love it. I definitely recommend this item."
1,"This movie is an insult to the image portrayed by Frank Herbert in his Dune books. Not only does it ignore some of the most important aspects which Frank Herbert included in his books, but it is also neglegent in that it does not show any real cinematic quality. The internal monologes are long and often incomprehensible unless the viewer has read the book version, and even then there is confusion in that the movie does not corespond with the book in many aspects."
2,"This review is strictly limited to the print quality of the new Universal Vault Series DVD R version...it is anamorphic widescreen and looks to be remastered. The colors are vibrant and crisp and it is a joy to watch...I'd avoid the full frame versions (some of which are ridiculously priced) and stick with this relatively inexpensive version of one of the hardest to find Lancaster/Aldrich flicks.... The other reviewers cover the film , mine is just to assure others that this version will not disappoint."
2,"I purchased all three of Ms DuBay's books, her trilogy on Limoges: Living With Limoges, Antique Limoges at Home, and Collecting Hand Painted Limoges Porcelain, Boxes to Vases. I purchased these books at a presentation she gave to our Antiquarium Society and I am thrilled! Ms DuBay's books are outstanding, informative, beautiful, have thousands of colored photographs and are value guides. Debby explained to us how to identify antique pieces of Limoges, about the back stamps and the decoration. All of this information is in the back of her books. I highly recommend Ms DuBay as a guest speaker and her books to all who love art and Limoges porcelain. She truly is the Lord of Limoges."
2,"The Stand is unparalled in character development; there are so many characters, all fascinating, including a dog. This is the book for readers who do not read horror novels but want to see the best of King's writing."
2,"Something about the fonts....if a font isn't installed on your computer you can't properly edit?? I don't understand but will say this. I feel many improvements were made over earlier versions. I love the text attribute toolbar so you can change font size, color, alignment, etc. Look forward to learning more as I use it more."
2,"The Step F1053 Home TrainerI'm short. Working at a standard counter hurts-- my arms, shoulders and back. This item is the right size and width to be able to live under my counter and light enough to kick from counter to counter. I can reach higher on shelves, be comfortable working at counters and at the sink. Works great."
1,This is obviously the authors first attempt at a book. Fortunately his writing improved. Skip this one and go on to the rest of his books which are quite good.
2,"This was given to me by my husband as a stocking stuffer. I gave the Father to Son one to my husband while in the hospital after giving birth. I think these books are wonderful, and make a great gift for a new parent. Some words of wisdom will make you cry (blame it on the hormones), and others will make you laugh. I'm going to give these books to any new parent I know."
2,"The Fenwick Techna AV series of fishing rods is perfect for the type of deep, clear water light tackle fishing I do. It's too bad they don't make them any more."
2,"Parent Talk is the parenting equivalent to the Betty Crocker Cookbook for the kitchen. I mean you will take this book off the shelf again and again and again. It is organized to be a very handy ready reference. It has a quite useful table of contents which structures the book around the ages of the child. This is helpful since the issues in rearing a todler are so different from those of our teenagers.This book helps us understand our children's behavior and, of course, it offers real practical steps to guide our children through their turmoil."
1,"This is possibly the worst transfer of data into digital format that I have ever heard. I have a 30 year old copy of this album on vinyl that I carefully recorded in MP3 format. The quality of this home recording maintains the fidelity of the original recording infinitely better than this CD. I bought the CD hoping for a better digital format, not worse. I am sending back this opened and played CD to Amazon.com today. Let's see how they respond to a return that is based soley on the fact that it is an incredibly inferior product. One final note. The music of the original recording will make any effort you take to find one of the older vinyls well worth your effort."
1,"Respectable publisher, respectable series. I was expecting presentation level, scope and depth similar to Eberly's ""Game Physics"". Unfortunately, mistake. This is a book for someone who just graduated from American high school and knows only so called ""algebra"" (+, -, *, / with calculator, no fractions). No question, there are such individuals, they have to learn, and for them this is pretty good book. I was fooled by impressive Table of Contents and number of pages. Was useless for me. Lesson learned: if you want Eberly's quality, buy Eberly's books"
1,I had looked up the sizing chart on this product and had purchased a large according to what I had found. The fins were way too small! Toes were pinched and were sticking out of the top. My recommendation is to order a larger size than the chart says.
2,"Very good product to hold all the 8x10 photos, I have created an album of 8x10s with all the important photos of our life.Only thing I don't like is that there is no indication anywhere, to indicate which is front side or back, Well there is one on the back side, but they are all black in color so it is not obvious."
1,"We bought 2 of these sixteen months ago and the one installed by my gas stove died completely. I was smelling gas, and called the gas company who fixed the leak, discovered this faulty device and told me I was blessed not to have killed myself as well as my neighborhood. Please beware, don't buy this SafetySiren HS80504)"
1,"The LED display didn't work very well and the actual settings steps did not correspond to the instructions. I finally just gave up and tossed the device in a box. I'd return it, but since it wasn't very expensive, at all, and the hassle of repackaging and taking it the post office, and contacting the vendor, etc. are all sufficient enough a deterrent to cause me to just consider this a bad purchase. I should have purchased one locally from a Bike shop, so that I could have just more easily taken it back in for an exchange or refund. This was one of those ""You get what you pay for"" bargains...I paid next to nothing and that's what I received in return. Lesson learned."
2,"Feels like my bf's $1000 bed. But it comes with a chemical smell and it is strong. The smell seems to be fating after 2 weeks of opening it. But it is still there. Be prepare to have a long period of time of waiting before actually putting it to your bed.Also, about the size. I thought it is too short for a twin as well. But my bf told me my dorm bed is an extra long twin. So that might be the reason for the complain of length."
2,"I had to start/stop this video four times (and it's probably only about 80 minutes) because I kept crying! It's absolutely heartbreaking. It's probably not something you'd want to watch over and over (too depressing), but definitely worth checking out!"
1,"I liked things like Frisky Dingo, so I thought I'd like Space Ghost. But to be honest, I can't even see what they were trying to do, I didn't fine it entertaining at all. I'm sorry."
2,I'm very pleased with this track ball mouse. It is easy to set up and use. Its color matched the laptop also.
1,It's not like new it's took bad How said it's like new when i got the book it's very bad :(
1,"William Pleeth did not write this book. He talked, in an abstract, discursive manner, around various subjects having remotely or less remotely to do with the cello, and someone transcribed some of his conversation. One of the chapters was written entirely by the transcriber (and not particularly well) with no contribution from William Pleeth.You may find this book ""inspirational"", if you like vague speech-making, but you are unlikely to find it of practical value. Mr. Pleeth never deigns to consider the nitty-gritty; he never rolls up his sleeves and sets to work."
2,"I bought this wire wheel to replace the medium wheel on my GR 150 grinder.Perfect for cleaning the threads on manifold bolts and removing rust off of tools.Make sure you use the right arbor.Causes a little vibration at first,but it goes away with use.Nothing I can't live with."
1,"i purchased this in April of 2010 and used it off and on ever since and the other day it just died. Is there any warranty of these? more than a year? going to look for my original paperwork...thought it woud last longer than this. Albeit, did the job just great when it was working! :)"
1,"I have only read about 5% of the book and am already annoyed because the book is titled, ""Favorite GREEK Myths,"" and yet the Roman gods names are being used. Yes the myths of Greeks and Romans are almost exactly the same, but still when writting about GREEK gods, the GREEK names should be honored!"
2,"I highly recommend this to anyone who loves Dark Shadows.Dark Shadows - Bloopers and TreasuresThe series itself was great and was filmed live which makes it prime for bloopers. For those who never had the priviledge to see the series, this is still a great thing to have because it was live, something you don't see these days. I loved the series and never missed an episode when it played. The characters are endearing, and they handle their bloopers with poise, continuing the scene. A Fan From The Beginning. I'd love for it to be on TV in reruns again. I wouldn't ever miss a show."
1,"I bought these boots in the middle of December, and found them to be very well suited to what I needed them for (working as a cart attendant in western Michigan). Unfortunately, over the last month and a half, they have developed a number of problems of varying severity have ensued (listed in chronological order):1) The insoles that were included in the boot wore out within a week of their arrival. Not a big deal, but it did make the boots rather uncomfortable until I could replace them.2) One of the eyelets yanked out of the leather. This didn't impede my ability to wear them any.3) One of the laces broke, which was of course easily replaced.4) Holes began to develop in the sole. It is at the point now where they need to replaced soon.Now, I walk pigeon toed and I am particularly hard on shoes, but 1.5 months seems to be a very short life span. I've gotten a longer lifetime out of my cheap wal-mart tennis shoes."
2,"Mary Higgins Clark is amazing. She is so talented. Having also read 2 of her other books, i liked this one the best. Perhaps, it is because this is the only one i understood thoroughly. The suspense present in those pages make you want to pursue your reading to see what happens afterwards. Like many of this author's other books, we can see that she makes us suspect the one person that is not the murderer or the criminal. Therefore, she puts us on the wrong path. At the end, you figure out that the bad guy in the story is the one you would have least expected. For example, I would have never thought that Hefferman was that important in the story. I thought he was just there to mislead us. But i sort of suspected Carter near the end. Clark's way of narrating is great. An advice to people whose eye is out for an adventure: read this book!!!!!"
1,"I was excited to play this game with the kids. Like the other reviews say, it is a good idea poorly executed. MOST of the questions are completely ambiguous and could possibly have more than one answer. Our 12 year old smoked us because the ""kids"" questions were suitable for 6 year olds. Some of the questions were just flat incorrect. Ive never heard of the company Spin Master before who makes the game but I won't purchase from them again"
1,Have bought 3 VHS tapes and they have gone bad after 2 months of use. I have tried them on 3 different VCRs. Can I get another tape at no charge or is it possible to get this on DVD?Thank you
1,"These are misrepresented as a refill pack. It is a lie. They are shorter bags by 2"". They do not work for me, I have large dogs.I will never buy Bags on Board again. I've written the company and they have ignored me."
1,"Within five minutes of opening and assembling this item, it broke. The plastic is cheap and had to be super-glued together. Granted it's still together and holds plenty of ties well, it doesn't spin anymore. Go find something else."
1,"After reading such glowing reviews from this site, I purchased this toaster model for my mother. Before giving it as a gift, I decided to test it. I am so glad I did!One side of the bread was burnt, while the other side was only a quarter toasted. And no, it was not on a setting other than toast. I thought it may have been, so I tested it again. The results were the same.I have had other B & D appliances and have always been satisfied. This was a real disappointment for me.I ended up purchasing a Sunbeam 6224 toaster. It works great! Save your time and money and get the Sunbeam.I never knew finding a taoster would be such an ordeal!OleSt. Cloud, MN"
2,"It covers to the point and I recommend this book for those who are interested in getting Sun's Certification on Java Programming. You must know the basics of Java to some extent to start going with this book. After completion of Sun's Java Tutorial topics ""Your First Cup of Java"", ""Getting Started"", ""Learning the Java Language"", and ""Writing Applets""; I scheduled 20 pages of ""The Complete Java 2 Certification Study Guide"" per day, it went very well and completed in 20 days. It covers what is required for the exam.At the end of every chapter there is a test, in which you try to score between 8-10. This is immediately after completion of the chapter. You should also try all the tests after completion of reading the book, which will pin point which area you have to concentrate on. Best of luck."
2,"This cd was sweet!!!! rollin' (air raid vechile) is the best. other great tunes are my way, take a look around and getcha groove on.the one thing i dont like is how much cussing there is.hot dog is a good example. the f word has to be used 32 times. great cd but fred's gotta lay off the cussing."
2,I've been in a Disciple bible study class for 5 years and have seen others with this book; finally decided to order it for myself. It's a great resource and has good information that is factual and concise. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Bible!
1,"I ordered this blanket because I wanted a white vellux blanket and have had problems finding a white one, so I jumped on the chance to purchase this one. Well, I received it and it looked yellow, so I returned it. Got a replacement thinking that it was just labeled wrong. My replacement that came yesterday was the same pale yellow. These are great blankets if you want something other than white, but if you're looking for a white blanket, you'll be out of luck."
2,Great shippingg... Lee has always made great paints. Good fit and I'm sure long lasting.Here's your 3 more words.
1,Got this for my wife for Christmas. We finally had the opportunity to attempt to use this in Mid February. Unit is dead and was never used. Not good.
2,Gerard Lesne is at his best here with a disc giving a rare slice of Portuguese music from 1500. I have listened to this disc countless times and the nuances and joy of Lesne and the artists he works with only manifest more. An album of delight and discovery.
2,"A superb book! Lots of information about people and how they lived in the Wild West. The illustrations and photos are very good, they brings the persons alive and makes them real."
1,"This was a nice try, but Dessi is just not the Norma we've been waiting for.....she does an admirable job acting and doing her best vocally, but the voice has aged, and although her stage experience helps her get through this, you do have the feeling like she is ""getting through it"" instead of becoming Norma. I have 10 Norma dvds, and I think the only one that has a true Norma voice singing the title role is the Montserrat Caballe Norma from the L'Orange festival. She is amazing in it."
2,"You really have to watch this movie carefully. Otherwise, you will lose the magic and just feel really bored with it."
2,I read this whole series.. I suggest you start with the first book and go to the last. It follows on with the people. I love this and would recomend this for any one. I think Stephanie Grace Whitson is a really good author.
1,"My dentist highly recommended this toothbrush to massage my gums. It took some getting used to because of the high-speed vibrations that tickle the gums. My teeth felt smooth after use, just like getting a cleaning at the dentist's office.I set it aside after a year or two. Recently I decided to use it again after several years. It would not take a charge. I decided the batteries might need replacement and found a site on the Internet that explained how to dismantle the unit and replace the batteries. This unit is not designed for home or factory service. The parts and the batteries are anchored in epoxy at the factory. Considering that nickel-cadmium batteries last less than four or five years, this unit is fairly expensive , especially at the price I paid.Changing the batteries is a time consuming effort. Even after finishing the job, the toothbrush will not work. It is an expensive throwaway."
2,"This is the nicest standard zoom lens you'll find. It's sharp, high-contrast, and low aberration at nearly all zoom levels and apertures. If you're going to step your toes into Canon's L line, this is the place to start. Giving you five standard focal lengths (24, 28, 35, 50, and 70 mm) this lens is an ideal high-quality everyday lens. Further, the quiet USM autofocuses nearly instantly, and the full-time manual focus ring rotates like butter.If I had to pick one problem with this, it would be the weight. At about 2.5lbs, it's surprisingly heavy, especially when you've been wielding it for several hours. Also, it's immense size grabs the attention of strangers, which depending on what you're doing, could be problematic.But in the end, when what I'm doing demands high quality and versatility, this is the lens I rely on. It is the standard-zoom staple of my travel pack, and if limited to only what's attached to the camera, this is the lens that comes."
2,"This is such an awesome grip. It made my 15 years old Ruger P89 looks brand new! Not only it looks great, but it fits great. It also feels better shooting my P89 for sure. I highly recommend this grip on your Ruger P series."
1,"Hey do not buy this !!it is the biggest waste of money ever, the picture and sound quality is real bad!! Its just a cheap way for people to make a buck out of 2pacs name.It is rather degrading to see what people would do to earn a bit of money, Tupac was all about quality and he would only want his fans to get the best, WHICH IS NOT THIS DVD!!"
1,"Barbara Michaels usually writes wonderful Gothic romances with great plot twists, wonderful characters and witty dialogue. You won't find any of that here. I had to force myself to finish this dreadful book.The ""heroine"" is actually the plain-looking and plain-spoken sister Jane. The governess who you think will be the heroine is a pretty idiot who can't see the obvious flaws in the man she works so hard to entrap. Except for Jane and a few workmen, every character in this book is so boorish, selfish or sociopathic that you don't care what happens to them.Forget this book. Read instead Michaels' clever ""Stitches in Time"" or her even better ""Wait for What Will Come."" They're both so excellent you'll mourn when you come to the last page."
2,"To think of Petra and the music that this group has put out is just ""Out of this World"". The music, message and lyrics are powerful (as usual). I recommend this album to anyone young or old who loves to turn up your music and are not ashamed to blast it to the car next to you."
2,"It's a large, multi-outlet surge protector. I would have preferred a black color, but it only seems to come in white. Be aware that the protector is rather tall when placed on the floor - it may not fit under some furniture when you plug things into it."
1,"It's easy to give this book one star and walk away, forgetting one ever read it in the first place."
1,"Purchased these headphones about 10 days ago and already one side is not working. Fit was poor and always falling out. Sound quality is ok, but I am not an audiophile and really how good does sound quality have to be when you are exercising. The cord does not excessively sway due to shortness, but if you are tall (like my exercise partner) be ready for a pulling sensation. One good thing about the poor fit is that traffic is easy to hear so there is little chance of getting run over from a car you didn't hear."
2,I have been A Lisa Samson fan for along time now. But i have to say that this book is the best she's ever written. I read it almost every year Its just that good.it will have you laughing out loud and crying right along with the charactors in the story the person in the story is LARK Summerville who grew up in a very well to do neighberhood with a very Sofistcated parents. when lark is old enough she moves out as soon as possible. and starts her own prayerlineand raises her daughter on own after her boy friend leaves her.she tries to run from her past but it has boomarang affect on her when her home is damaged by fire. this takes her back to living with her mom in her pristine home.when all she wanted to do was leave her scolite past behind her.
2,"Hi! I'm KitKat's mom in Watsonville, CA. I just had to put in my review of this fantastic group. I enjoy (love) to listen to their music and their incredible dancing skills. The guys always look like they're having fun. Recently KitKat had an *NSYNC birthday. *NSYNC t-shirts, calendar, latest BOP magazines, IN THE MIX video, their official book and even her cake. I had a computerized color photo of the guys on her cake. Of course we didn't eat the top half of the cake with all their faces on it only the bottom half. The rest of the cake has been put into our freezer forever!!!!! I just have to say I think the group is so talented and caring about their fans. We hope they'll be around for a long, long time. We're waiting for their next CD -- HURRY! Good luck guys!"
2,The Tree Gator works well in drought conditions. Every two days we fill the Tree Gator to water our trees -- it's easy and convenient and the trees are doing very well indeed.
2,"Equipment is very useful, monitor is neat, clear, precise images. Audio is very good."
1,"The first time I read this book I had already sworn not to spend one more dime on any weight-loss product ever again, including books, so I took it out of the library. Like most, I read the book and thought OK, so where do you get hcg injections if they're not legal in the USA. Of course if you subscribe to his website (an additional $10 a month) he will tell you. No Thanks!I recently saw a naturopathic physician who recommended hcg therapy for weight loss. She told me she had several patients who used it and she used it herself with fantastic results. She said the product is exactly what he wrote about in his book. She told me she would support me and told me how to go about getting it. The thing is, he sounds so crazy it's hard to believe anything he writes. He sounds like he needs to be locked up in a mental institution!"
2,Waited a long time to get my hands on this. Fats can still show the youngsters how to rock - even with slow numbers. A 'must have' for all dedicated Fats' fans
2,"Great Movies both on 1 DvD good deal. But demon Knights was the bomb. Full of fun, horror, and blood. The Crypt Keeper have you wanting more ."
1,"I purchased this for my 18 month old only for the reusable stickers part of the book. The pages to stick them on are too busy and they match the stickers colors and scenes. It is hard to tell where the stickers are and its boring. There is 5 pages of a story and 12 pages of puzzles. Approximately 60 reusable stickers ranging in size from 1/2"" - 3-1/2"" long. There are 3 -2 page scenes to use the reusable stickers. I will put it away and bring it out later and see if it has better results."
2,Good story and characters the story gets better as it goes. Recommend this book to your friends.I would watch the movie.
1,"I've had this for three years. It worked ok for while. Now the remote module won't communicate with the base thermometer, which kind of defeats the purpose. They still work fine as two separate thermometers. However, now the probes are starting to fail. The probe wires are pretty flimsy in my opinion and shouldn't be subjected to extreme heat like open flames.I would give it 2.5 stars but 2 will have to do."
1,"What good is a pre-seasoned skillet if it comes to you with rusty spots? I scoured it under hot water and attempted to dry it with paper towels. The pan surface shredded the paper towels. This doesn't make sense. Cast-iron pans should be smooth, not evenly pebbled like a sand casting. Shame on Lodge for not finishing the job."
1,"This is not a CD of songs - don't be fooled. This is a reading of an unauthorised biography and doesn't even use Evanescence as the background music. If you are a total fan and want something about the band, but not by the band, go ahead. I know I love the music and would not have purchased this if I knew it was not a music CD."
1,If I've ever seen a rodent trap that PETA would approve of this one would have to be it.Three months of ownership and multiple rodents caught by traditional traps and this one is still waiting for its first kill.Bait in it has never been touched. Apparently this thing screams death trap at rodents like nothing else ever could.
2,"I would recommend this book to anyone in the beginning stages of planning their wedding. It offers lots of advice on how to save money for those planning a wedding with a limited budget. The book also offers chapters specifically directed towards ethnic themes, the physically challenged, and away-from-home weddings."
2,"Admittedly, the science in Timeline is weak in comparison to other Crichton novels. However, I really stopped caring once he took me, convincingly, to the middle-ages. This book is one heck of an exciting adventure! -Stephen Prins, author of:Strife of the Lorin"
1,"This is a mediocre machine that makes steamed milk and coffee. However, it is advertised as a latte maker. It does not make latte's. Personally, I think it is false advertising.A Traditional ""Latte"" requires a shot of espresso and unless you have an espresso machine you can not make Latte's with this product. I had to purchase an additional espresso machine to make Latte's with this product.Buyer beware."
2,The Matrix is hands down the best movie to see this year. The special effects are amazing and the story line is unmatched. If you like movies that throw twists at you you will love this movie. There are not enough stars to give this one!!!
1,"I saw this on Dr. Oz and figured I'd try it. Who doesn't have stress in their lives ? So there is an eyedropper in bottle. You use 4 drops and you are supposed to feel magically better. I can't believe I fell for this. It tasted like Whiskey. It is a dropperful of alcohol. That's it. If I am going to have a whiskey to calm me, I'd rather have a Jameson on the rocks. (jk)"
1,"I admit that this author suggests some nice things and I'm sure that if you work his program it may or may not work. The problem is that all of his suggestions are cliche and lacking in originality and freshness. Nothing new here, same old song and dance."
2,"The sampling of the Beatles catalog from beginning (I Saw Her Standing There, All My Loving) to end (Let It Be, The Long and Winding Road, The End) and lots in between (Here There and Everywhere, Eleanor Rigby, The Fool on the Hill, Lady Madonna, Yesterday, Sgt. Pepper, Hey Jude) is enough to give this live version CD a full 5 stars.In addition there are some great versions of Paul's music while solo (Maybe I'm Amazed) and with Wings (Band on the Run, Jet).The fact that the songs span a time period of 40 years (1962-2002) and they are live rather than studio versions gives the listener a different perspective on this music from Paul McCartney, the Beatle who just can't stop performing. The only thing that would have been better is if Ringo had joined the tour and some of his work (It Don't Come Easy, Photograph) had been included. Maybe next time...."
2,"It's an interesting book in the series. A little strange and violent, but I couldn't put it down."
1,"I needed a louder telephone ringer, and purchased this item. I tried it when it arrived, but discovered that it was not any louder than the ringer in the phone. Also, there is something rattling inside the item, but it doesn't seem to interfere with the use of it----just shoddy workmanship. I would not recommend it for someone who wants a lound ringer, because this just doesn't do the trick. It would work fine for an added ringer, in a room without a telephone, but that's about it. For the hard of hearing, it's not too good."
1,"We love Jacob's Cream Crackers, which are made in the UK and which you almost can't find in our area. I thought these would be just as good (the packaging even looks like the Jacob's package), and I bought a whole case! Unfortunately, these crackers are not nearly as good as Jacob's. They have a strange, sour taste. They are not made in the UK, but in Brazil. Only one of my three kids will eat them--the other two tried them and refused to try them again. The crackers arrive crisp and well-packed, but the quality just isn't there. Jacob's, I'm sorry I strayed!"
2,"This book is an excellent presentation of the timing of the rapture, as is written in the Bible rather than what we might like it to be. Mr. Perry's approach is logical, easy to understand, and expounds the consistent message of scripture concerning the rapture from each book of the bible containing this message. This book is timely as it addresses the very dangerous heresies circulating throughout the Church these days. Read this book! You will be glad you did!"
1,The sound on this dvd is just gruesome. Performance is way below expected. This is one in a long line of music dvd's and bd's which has terrible sound. Why bother to release such items? Does not the producer or the performer LISTEN to the sound before release? I think not. What a waste of money. I am sick of beiing robbed with bad releases like this. Also- the other reviewers here- how can they give top ****** for this? Reviews like that are misleading consumers.
2,"First, I'd like to reiterate what everybody else has said - Helen Mirren's portrayal of Queen Elizabeth is superb. Her portrayal was very believable and sympathetic, as she showed a woman who, in the words of my dad, ""thought she was popular with the people, but found out that she wasn't nearly as popular as Diana, and that really shook her.""This movie is absorbing, thoughtful, revealing... and ironic. It's entitled ""The Queen,"" a title which would imply that it would cover the life of Elizabeth. In fact, this movie primarily covers a single week in her very long life as queen. And then, at the end of the movie, Tony Blair basically tells her that the week of Diana's death would just be a blip in people's memories - that people would remember Elizabeth for all of the things she'd done in her lifetime as queen, and not just for her reaction to Diana's death. But apparently that's not the case, if this movie is any indication."
2,"I purchased this book based on the recommendation of another photographer. I have found the book to be well written with excellent illustrations and guides. The only shortcoming, if it can be called such, is the persistant reference to film based cameras and their settings and controls. The text seems to have been written more to help someone who uses, or used, film and has little experience with a digital camera. This does NOT make the information any less relevant, just a little harder to grasp on the initial reading. With study and persistant application of the lessons, I found, and continue to find, the book to be very helpful. I am quite glad I ordered it and would give it very good marks."
1,This stuff sucks; it doesn't smell very good and it stings when you use it.I would try Jack Black Double Duty moisturizer instead.
2,Being a Charlie Chaplin fan I enjoyed this collection. It contains Chaplin's shorts. Aside from that I was disappointed that there were no documentaries or special features.
1,"...while reading this book. Part of the problem was the writing, which seemed more on the level of a young adult novel (and not a particularly well-written one), part was the lackluster characterization, and part was the fact that the story just wasn't very compelling. Two things in particular bothered me...(1) The relatively small disruption that the Rapture caused in the world, since people seemed to pick right up and carry on, as though nothing of import had happened.(2) The lack of power in the descriptions of various individual conversion experiences. I've done more spiritual soul searching when I started a diet than these people appear to do before repenting and accepting Christ.I also thought the names were pretty silly, as someone else noted, and that Nicolae was a boring villain. I won't be reading any of the sequels."
2,"This book was one of the best books i ever read. I got it on sunday and finished i on monday morning. An all night read, and i haven't done that since 1982."
1,"I picked up this book after reading the author's article (in New Yorker) comparing himself to William Gaddis and insterting himself into the Gaddis, Pynchon, Barth, Delillo tradition. Sorry, but no.The Corrections is not a complete waste of time. The author is competent, but don't look to this novel for a really great literary experience. It's really a lot like watching television.In the author's article in the New Yorker, he references Barth's ""Sot-weed Factor"" as though it's some complex tome. It's not. You should read it instead of The Corrections."
2,This is a great toy! Wooden houses with little doors and keys are just perfect for my 3 year old. She loves this toy! She and her sister (age 8) play with it constantly.
2,"This is great, I only have 512Mb RAM and it runs on that memory. Recommend using 2 GB for all the amenities. Air traffic control, land air and sea traffic and the scenery. Expect to upgrade memory in July, On Soc. Sec. and anxious to use all of the program. Has photo taking abilities, logbook and some great aircraft. Wish it had an amphibian though, Has float plane and jets just like 2004 but much better. You won't be sorry if you purchase this Flight Simulator."
1,"Simply put, this kindergarden level book is simply not worth what I recently deposited in my bathroom."
2,"While it may be a bit unorthodox, we gave this to our puppy shiba inu. He absolutely adores it! I realize that the target audience may not be dogs, but I think it's nice to know that this toy is tough enough to stand up to months of puppy abuse, so you don't have to worry about a dog's safety with this around."
1,"This is a classic book on computer simulation, well read and cited. I read it before and bought a copy from Amazon for reference. However, the copy I bought was electronically reproduced. Although legible, it is a produt of poor quality, especially at $... for 237 pages.Compared with other books on the same topic, this book discussed dangers of poor random number generators in great detail, perhaps in an exaggerated way."
2,"Anyone who's experienced the L.A. dating scene will recognize the people in this puckish satire of contemporary sexual morays. Archie Gips, the writer/director of ""Loveless,"" used to produce for ""Blind Date,"" so he knows from dating humor! Highly recommended."
1,"This performance is a ""cutesy"" one, replete with little swells in the musical line, exaggerated dynamic contrasts, and rhythmic breaks that collectively weaken the overall impact of the music."
1,I have read all of Higgins Clark's book and have never been disappointed until I hit this one. The wriiting is awful. It seems as if her intent was to get a book out as soon as she could whether it was any good or not. I do not recommend this book!
2,Excellent product; solves all my jewellery storage needs in a very attractive armoire that manages to also match my bedroom furniture. Thank you!
1,I ordered this sync and charge cable. This cable only syncs but does not charge (and I made sure that my laptop was also plugged in to an outlet). I tried to contact both Amazon and Black Box for a refund and was unable to get a resolution. I would not recommend this product.
2,"I was having pain in my knee during spin class. No pain with device. Inexpensive.Be sure and measure before you order, so it is a snug fit."
2,"This is a really nice dryer. It is easy to install and adjust, and does what it needs to do. I am absolutely hooked on drying clothes outside -- I can get about 4 loads done in a morning -- it is much more convenient and quicker than using the clothes dryer.Do heed the weight restrictions, though. I overloaded mine with some heavy blankets. That was kind of a bummer -- but not the clothesline's fault!"
2,"Jean Jacques Rousseau is truly a great intellectual.His Discourses and The Social Contract are some of the best in Enlightenment thinking. In the Discourses Rousseau exalts the ""noble"" savage free from the corrupting influence of modern civilization. He believes that civilization has corrupted man from his original, yet ignorant state. I found the Discourses to be a little flighty and unrealistic. The Social Contract was a different story altogether. This is a monumental work. In it Rousseau shows his vast knowledge of the Roman Republic and Empire and the reasons for it's rise and collapse. Rousseau also denounces monarchy and aristocracy as forms of government and exalts republicanism. He also decries the power of organized religion in the oppression of mankind. With his ""General Will"" theory of the social contract he shows true brilliance. A great buy."
2,"Astounding 'historical' mayhem from some of the most talented musician writers that may pass this way in a long time. Seldom have I gone through so many emotions in an album and enjoyed myself so much. It's funny, in it's own crazy way, it's a bit... educational? The constant fearless dive between genres, and musical and cultural worlds make this album a rare gem. Oh yeah, and like a weird kind of Woody Allen film after all of this is done you will find moments to even feel passion. Mexican rock at it's finest and a gift forever. Oh yeah, it is indeed in Spanish, and if you don't know that it would be worth learning just to get these words.I need to refer to a comment regarding someone selling a copy of this on CD for $49. You may not believe it but I actually have seen someone asking $699 for a copy somewhere. Crazy or not, these possibly absurd figures accurately represent the passion that listeners have learned to feel from exposure to this work.Nuff said!"
2,"The line of the Kent famiy is followed through with Amanda Kent as the main player. Amanda, daughter of Gilbert Kent was kidnapped and held as a wife by an Indian brave until his death when she was released.She then married a fur trapper who also died,leaving her to m ake her living as a bar keeper until she was caught up in the Battle of the Alamo and again taken prisoner as the woman of a Mexican Officer.She was treated well by him and gave birth to his son,Louis. By chance, she met,very briefly, with her cousin Jared who had been searching for her for years and inherited, on behalf of his son Jephtha,the control of his share of a gold mine. Determined to restore the printing firm of Kent and Sons in Boston to the family control, she and Louis set up house in Boston where she battles for ownership of the firm from the evil Hamilton Stovall,the man who swindled her family of their fortune and business."
1,"I bought this because I like fantasy short stories and I thought the title was funny. There were only 3 stories I actually liked; TEACHER'S PET/Josepha Sherman, WERE-WENCH/Jan Stirling and BLOOD CALLS TO BLOOD/Elisabeth Waters. The rest were boring or unreadable. It has been 4 months since I got this book and its taken me this long to force myself to finish it. What a disappointment."
1,"I really wanted to like this book, and I did enjoy the first 250 pages. After that, the book's plot collapses into a confusing, gothic, absurd mess. It's really bad writing when - at the end of the book - the author has to have a character summarize/speculate the motives/reasons/etc. behind the murders. And even then, you'll probably be asking yourself, ""what?!""SPOILERS AHEAD - I can't even begin to count how many characters found out that who they thought were their parent(s) really weren't. They should have provided a chart at the end so a reader could understand how everyone was REALLY related to one another. And, the main plot of the book is to find out who murdered Honoria. Oh, you learn the man's alias, but you don't really know who he is and the ""why"" is a bit sketchy."
2,"The laws in real estate are constantly changing. However, the material provided in this course were very current and the overal quality of the book superceeded the need"
1,"This is the difinitive nu-metal album to me (and thats why it sucks). It is abosolute garbage, the only good song is 'freak on a leash'. There is zero talent in this band other than the johnathan davis, who should quit and find a real metal band. Terrible cd"
1,"Same exact experience as Ruppman and 71 Torino with XS 1500 - shows ""overload"" with only 1/5 capacity being used. Will not reset, battery replacement will not help, unit is a costly paperweight. Warranty probably expired (two years old). I could have made a much better purchase for $300.00... Not recommended."
2,"I loved this the first and second time I read it. I had itunder the title ""Red Star Rising"" I was disappointed as Ithought I had found another new book in the series. Where possible it might be best to list retitles somewhere. I thought the summary was familiar but didn't have access to the book to check."
2,"This CD is great for those who love the spaciousness of Rypdals compostions but also enjoy his rock style electric guitar work. Here he gives both and it works beautifully, resulting in a thoroughly satisfying album. His acoustic playing is very thoughtful as well. This album features shorter pieces but with the same flavor of some of his more lengthy compositions. His electric guitar tones are classic Rypdal."
2,"He has periods in life, I like it, thats all I will say. Listen to the samples. He is gone now so anything is nice to have. Found & bought from Amazon when I was looking for his ""Live at cafe au Go Go( and Soledad Prison) I do not think you will be terribly disappointed"
2,"The music couldn't be more enchanting. It moves you,it takes you to a state of U4. Massive Attack created some of the most complex soundscapes I have ever listened to!!"
2,"This is perfect for me. I enjoy keeping records of my hunts but never had a very organized way of doing it. The front of each page has fields for Date, County, State, Hunt Location, number in party, license type, permit stamps, permission granted, scouting by:, special requirements, species hunted, legal start time, legal end time, gps of starting position, cloud cover percent, barometer, wind direction ans speed, moon phase, temp and notes, glassing optics used, hunting methods, rut phase, rub or scrape marking/locations, scents used, locator calls used, decoys used, bait/feed used, sightings, firearm, caliber, type of ammo, bag limit, boone and crocket score, general health/appearance of animal. Then the back of the page is lined horizontally with dotted lines vertically that can be used to write anything you want. I list the gps points where I hunt and what I saw there. Waterproof paper."
1,"My fiance and I bought the book, and the two work books and were very much disappointed. It's focused on Christianity specifically, treats men and women as if they were two great masses of clones, etc. Multiple choice has a lot of room for interpretation - dangerous for a defensive person to be doing. I recommend the power of two workbook instead."
2,"This is truly a great paper trimmer. I agree with all the good reviews.One fair warning though: while mine was new as indicated, the blade had issues. It was not properly sharpened, and it was bent ever so slightly. It could not even cut a sheet or two of regular paper.I took it to a professional, and for about $20, they straightened it and sharpened it properly. After that, it cuts very well and stays sharp for a good while."
1,We do not think this video is worth purchasing. After receiving it and viewing it we were disappointed in its storyline and also the quality of the tape itself. I didn't think I would find a Tom Selleck movie I wouldn't want to watch but this is the one.
2,great job on this remake of the 60s it was my favorite when i was 8 and i love what you did to it now i can listen again in the 90s over and over again
1,I did not like most of the recepies that were in the book. They were too exotic for me. A couple of the desert recepies were ok and I did like the color pages that showed the food.
2,I bought these to be part of an entertainment unit I was creating myself. These were so easy to assemble! Like 10 minutes and there you go! The weight and quality is unreal for the price (especially if you get them on sale at the store for 74.00 and don't have to pay shipping!) I will buy more of these and would tell anyone hesitating about quality to go ahead and order because you won't be disappointed! - If they only had an entertainment center that matched this collection! Anyone who finds one let me know where Please!
1,"I didnt really like this book, I didn't find it scary at all it made me unintrested and not want to read it. There was really no mistery to keep you on the eagde of your seat."
1,"I also had a major problem finishing this one. One night I had chronic insomnia,a nd I managed. But only out of duty. Like many of the other reviews here, the book was spoilt by the author spoliticing, and all that on top of an unbelievably dull and unoriginal plot. Zero stars.Ralf"
1,"Lately, Motorola has been making horrible phones.This is the worst phone I ever bought.1. The battery doesn't even last for a day on standby and only about 45 mins talk time. The handset just goes dead in a day without warning.2. The handsfree speaker phone is bad.3. The door for the battery compartment on the base unit is almost impossible to open.4. Usually phones sort caller-id by the time the call was received at. But this phone doesn't even list the caller id in any order.I even exchanged the phone thinking I may have received a defective one. But the replacement turned out to be as horrible as the first. Don't waste your hard earned money on this junk."
2,"At first I thought it was going to be another boring books about bombs, boy was I wrong. This book will teach the novice everything he/she would ever want to know about the subject. With the stunning color photos and in-depth drawings of various bombs this book is a perfect buy."
2,Worked very well and I am very happy with this product. They create a smooth appearance when wearing clothes that are fitted. Excellent purchase.
2,"If you look at the title ""Dinosaurs on a Spaceship"" and think ""That's silly. I won't like it,"" then you won't. If you look at that title and think ""F*#$ yes I want dinosaurs on a spaceship. And throw in some Egyptians,"" then you will. As a bonus, Mitchell and Webb!"
1,"Being that I am a history buff, I was so excited when I bought this book. I couldn't have been more wrong. Normally, I can finish a book in six hours; this book took me three weeks. I kept falling asleep reading it!There are no characters or a plot, it reads like a term paper--just facts and dates. It vaguely mentions the lives and events of the ordinary people in the year 1000, and it appears that the authors didn't make an effort to even try to make this book interesting.Do yourself a favor and do not buy this book, unless you need help falling asleep."
1,"This book started really strong and started dying about half way through. The first half flowed pretty nicely, the authors all had very close styles of writing that made it really enjoyable. About half way through, one of the big characters just disappeared and became a minor one, the styles of writing changed, sex and violence suddenly were added in what seemed like a PG-rated book, and the flow of events suddenly changed and left you confused. At the end, things seemed to make some sense, but at the same time your thinking ""What?"" Started strong, ended badly. Too bad too, I really liked Booger."
1,"Don't bother getting this book. Several of the things it says to do are illegal, like go do Graffiti, & get arrested, Other's most people will not able to do such as get a painting in a gallery or write a great American novel.If your want to do something fun and new save your money use Google, & take the money you saved & buy something fun."
2,Classical Christmas was a very beautiful rendition of Christmas music. I'll be adding it to my CD collection to play at Christmas time in the future.
2,"A wonderful book about best friends living the basics of life: love, tragedy, dreams, reality, growing far apart, growing close together, humor, sensitivity, probing. The kind of book to give friends of all ages who face life full force and grow. These two wonderful African American women, whose lives were strongly shaped by their race and their gender, but with a story that transcends all isms. ""For the first time the past they shared met the women they had become, and once again their dreams forthe future included each other."" Honest, clear. Great read."
2,"The lovers hide their feelings; overcome many obstacles, finally (after four years of separation) find one another and express their true feelings. The reader comes to only one conclusion: they live happily everafter."
2,Two things make this tape unique: The thick rubber housing around the tape. If you drop it no damage is done to the tape or the floor. The rubber housing also sits flush with the end hook on the tape to protect it from getting bent. The one inch blade is easy to read and always fully returns in the housing.
1,I saw one of these knives and just had to have one. should have bought the one with the fixed blade.REtracting this blade is ridiculous.Sure it can be done by working the knob but i cut one piece of drywall and had to loosen it so much to get the blade to move that the knife was ready to pop open. what a joke. Oh and my poor sore thumb from working that big knob!!!
1,"As much as I enjoy Slim Man and Bona Fide on stage, sorry, this CD doesn't have any of that magic vibe in the recording.Slim Man has a certain on-stage vibe, but it doesn't translate in recordings, least of all this recording.See him live? Yes.Love this CD? No."
1,"After having read this ""novel"", I long for the days of ""All that Remains"" and ""Postmorteum"". The author has attempted to write the worst book she could have written and she has been successful. There is absolutely no plot or anything of interest to hold the viewer's attention. West, Hammer and Brazil were far more interesting in the ""Hornet's Nest"". I will put this implausible puppy aside and wait for Grisham in three weeks. Let us hope that the author returns to Scarpetta next year. It is unfortunate to have go two years for a quality book from an author who has demonstrated such talent. Save you money and wait for the movie."
2,"Interesting book. As above, Vigoda got it right. Read this book on a dark windy night and wonder what tomorrow brings."
2,"Don Pullen is an extraordinary pianist of genius. It is a wonder why this world of music does not recognize true genius when it comes on the scene. We idolize the Pavarottis and the Perlmans,the Armstrongs and the Jacksons but unless there is a concerted effort to make people headline stars true genius gets little or no recognition. Pullen is an improvisor on the caliber of a Mozart or Liszt and it is truly evident on the CD ""Live at the Village Vangaurd"". We can praise an Ellington to the skies and immortalize him and it is time to start to look to our great artists like Pullen and put them in the pantheon of of true geniuses of divine inspiration."
2,"If your at all interested in getting a Golden Retriever, by all means get this book! It is full of information that you need and should know. It tells you more than other books I have read. When I am ready for a puppy, now I know its the breed for me!"
1,I used these gloves once under my boxing gloves and the gel beads started to leak. After just one use! Bad quality.
1,"""Up to the minute"".???Hardly!!March 2005, the publication date, is a loooong time ago in ipod years, if you have one of the new models, video 60 Gig for example, you will be sorely dissapointed, it talks about the nano and photo i pod as the ""latest edition to the ipod family"", well they are now teenagers and probably due to be retired at any moment, ipod mini anyone? Those things are Neolithic now, yet are given too much space in this ""up to the minute"" book as if they had just been released!Go to Borders, look thru their ipod books and find the one with your ipod in it, if you have a brand new one as at May 2006."
2,"I grew up watching Tyley Ross onstage (in Tommy, Miss Saigon, in concert, etc) and always admired his singing and diversity, and when I got word of EVOC I was thrilled that he's ever-evolving and still singing.I bought this CD the day it came out and I haven't stopped listening to it yet. EVOC has maintained the musical integrity of the opera it presents and has only heightened it's excitement for today's audience. I can't wait for more from them. Keep singing Tyley!"
1,Amazon: This chipper was not what we expected. We had to feed leaves by hand and was disappointed in the way it mulched the leaves as we were trying to bag them with no luck from the mulcher into the bag. We received a confirmation of our refund 2/9/07. Our Amazon-Chase card has not been credited for the amount as of 3/1/07. The chipper has been returned. Will be waiting to be credited for the amount of 215.96. Thank you
2,"it would be better if you could purchase additional slides. My son is a science nut, but even he has tired of looking at the same group of slides over & over. You can put other slides under and look at them but you don't get the great info you do with the set that the microscope came with. It is a wonderful toy for a budding scientist or entymologist, though!"
2,Just recieved this. I was able to read it in about an hour. It is a shorter version of other books that have been written about the zero fighter. It goes into the design development testing & combat of the zero. The is a very short list of zero aces short biographies like can be found in books by Hata & Sakaida. At the back is a nice little breakdown of the different versions & fighters developed to replace it. As well as a few army planes. If you have other books about the zero it may be best to save your money. A lot of whats in here is a repeat of those other books.
2,I love that she isn't afraid to tackle the most difficult of parenting issues and offers practical and very specific solutions that can work for many. Her approach is firm but loving. I agree with others that it is not a completely well-rounded book and doesn't address prevention of situations which is crucial.Enjoying the Ride
1,"I have followed all instructions, I have cleaned the filters regularly and this piece of doggy doo won't pick up the smallest of mess on the floor. I realize I only paid $50.00 for this piece of junk, but you would think that companies would take some pride in the quality of the products they put their name on. I guess if you don't have the budget to spend $500 on a vacuum then you are just out of luck."
1,We installed new six years ago. After 3 years the faucet stuck in open and we had to spend nearly $400 for a new faucet plus the plumber. Now the hot water tank is leaking and we had to buy a new tank for over $200 and pay a plumber to install. So count on replacing the initial cost time and time again. The company obviously has not got good designs and just wants to sell replacements that cannot be repaired.
1,"After loving the time travel books, this was a disappointment. I never really connected with the characters, and while there was some interesting information about the Civil War and General Lee, I never really figured out the point of the book."
2,hardest part was getting it out of the packaging. after that it was smooth sailing
2,"Even though this book was as advertised, it did not contain all of the information I wanted. I experienced no problems with the return."
2,"I have been in a relationship with a man with a narcissistic personality disorder for 13 years. We have 2 children together and I am also raising 3 of his older children. For years and years and years, I have been so unhappy and confused and this book has opened my eyes to what is truly going on. I devoured it in 24 hrs and it has given me the courage to start the process of self-healing and assertion. The only reason I did not give it a 5 is that I would have liked a bit more specific 'instructions' on where to go from here rather than the strong advice to seek therapy, which I cannot afford. But overall, the best book to help you understand and to start with."
1,"They call it ""200mg"" but in reality it is only 16mg of Resveratrol.This is very misleading.If they are willing to be misleading on their webpage and label, I would wonder about their quality control and contents as well.I won't trust them again."
1,"Terrible, terrible, terrible, is all I have to say. I watched this with my mother, a college professor and fellow literary aficionado.I really don't understand people who applaud this movie. Hester Prynne's eyes looked like she was blind, they were so white. It was distracting and very strange. Pearl was just odd, and Roger Chillingworth looked like a mad hatter. Which he is, I suppose, so there's that.Rev. Dimmsdale is rather handsome, but that is not the point!!The camerawork looks as if someone filmed when drunk, it's so cheap.The entire thing looks like some middle-schooler's lame attempt to make a little movie.After reading The Scarlet Letter, I expected--nay, hoped for--an accessible film version of the classic. Disappointment, disappointment, disappointment.Personally, I really enjoyed the Demi Moore adaptation of this novel."
1,"The charger failed and ruined the battery. Replaced the charger and battery and the replacement charger failed. Bosch did a recall on the 14V model due to the charger, but I have not seen a recall for the 12V model although there must be a similar issue."
2,"I was please to find this hard to track down book. It was in perfect condition when I received it, still even having a protective plastic wrap on the book!"
2,Love the sound from this woofer . I purchased this around 2 weeks ago and Amazon got it to me fast ! This is great for the home surround sound and the bass sound is excellent by giving enough bass but yet it wont rattle the windows . It also has the volume control button on the back of woofer and also the on and off switch is on the back which is convient if you have little ones around the house . Nice woofer for the money .
1,"I ordered these for a 2007 base mini and they don't fit. In any case, they aren't even close.UPDATE: after some research it looks like these are meant for the convertible only. If that's the case, the choosing tool and description need updated. I ordered the EUR1204s so I'll see how that goes.UPDATE #2: I finally installed the EUR1204s which fit sort of as long as you have a grinder. The inside shoes do not fit and need to be reshapped to be installed, so I guess they really don't fit. The shoes are larger than stock and hang over the inside rim of the rotor. I kept the OEM shoes and will take them to a local shop and check the fit next time I need shoes."
1,"The buzz I remember from this when it was a theatrical release was how Natalie Portman's nude scenes were cut. Aparently they also cut the interesting and engaging dialog also. This could not have been any worse if they cast the teletubbies as the 4 characters as the actors. For the guys out there the strip club scenes did not have any nudity. Not that a film needs nudity, but this was a symptom of the pollitically correct crowd ruining a film. Not at all believeable acting. This film should be banned as a terrorist act.I hated it, and threw out my copy, rather than sell it and subject someone else to it."
2,"When it comes to choral music, i love clean and well tuned voices, thick, solid, clean, and well sung. All the music in the cd inspires the cathedral and pure choral music that is at its best form. You just have to listen to this music. If you love choral music and if you love excellent vocal A'Capella music, this cd is a must."
2,"I like it very much. It is very quiet, lite and pretty color. I am doing kitchen renovation and using this vacuum cleaner is a big help."
1,I ordered this item but received an alternative. What I ordered used 2 AAA batteries & weighed 1.12 ounces. What I received uses 2 AA batteries & weighs 2.5 oz.
1,"I recently watched this movie, hoping to see a quality rendition of Hawthorne's classic novel, but I was disappointed with Moore's performance. I'm used to seeing Moore in action roles such as G.I. Jane and Charlie's Angels II, so it just didn't see like a good fit for her to be playing a stuffy Puritan. I couldn't take her role seriously in the Scarlett Letter, particularly with her accent. I just about gagged in one scene where she says, ""Reverend Dimmesdale, I must apologize for my forthrighteousness on Sabbath last..."" Um, does that mean, ""I'm sorry I was so blunt last Sunday""?This movie would be so much better to watch with a different acress."
1,"The price on this set was great, and I thought it was a wonderful deal at first. However, this dvd set has not been re-mastered at all- movie quality is worse than I remember Little Rascals beings. Also, over half the episodes are more of a ""history of little"" rascals with commentary as opposed to the DVDs that contain only episodes. Out of 4 DVDs, I think only one (poss two) have Little Rascals Episodes on them (as opposed to the ""documentary"" of ""Our Gang."" I was disappointed. Next time, I'll spend the extra money to get more episodes."
1,"I bought the three stooges curley classics and couldn't get it to play at all. The dvd player keeps telling me there is NO Disc in player. So i went out and Bought the Three Stooges Collection with Spook Louder,All The Worlds A Stooge and Curly Classics in it and guess what Spook louder and All The Worlds A Stooge play great and the Curly Classics one don't play at all the player is saying NO Disc in player just like the first one i bought i think they better look in to this matter.I would like to know if anybody else is having this problem."
1,Worst thing I ever saw. Half the time the video is not even on the subject. The video is around 10 minutes long. The instructions for the tricks are on an audio cassette. Don't waste your money!!!!!!
1,"I purchased this book hoping that the other reviewers were wrong. Guess what, they were right! This book was really bad! The only reason I did'nt give it one star was the storyline was intresting, but the writer did'nt know how to make the most of it."
2,"Edred Thorsson is one of the foremost experts I know in rune magic. His book is scholarly and very well fundamented. His knowledge and understanding of Norse and Germanic languages, mythology and cosmology is made clear in this book, which deals mainly with runic archetypes and runic talismans. In this book you will find interesting and profound rituals/meditations to attune yourself to the runic archetypes and memes. THIS BOOK DOES NOT INCLUDE DIVINATION TECHNIQUES, which I find a positive point, just as a good book on astrology should not include 'general' horoscopes."
2,"I'm new to digital and wanted an easy camera for quick shots. So far the vivitar 3935 has done well. It takes much better outdoor photos, it appears to need lots of good lighting. The software sent with the camera is very basic but alows you to make some minor editing, resize images, etc. I've been using a 128mb sd card for memory and it has worked very well with no problems. I stored aproximatley 50 pictures on it from one day and had space left for more. In the ""fine"" quality setting, pictures were about 10mb a picture, so if you want a lot of large photo's you may need a bigger memory card.My only concern so far is the poor battery life. It lasted me aprox 45 minutes taking 15 photos-After that it was spent. I purchased a pack of 4 w/charger. They seem to work well for swapping.I purchased the camera for $149 and belive that the battery hassle is worth the $1-200 saved compaired to other models."
1,"this stuff is worthless , it is basicly fine carbon and some resins stuffes in a fine mess bag, problem is the media bag its in is so fine and the contests fo fine , its hard to get water to flow thru it and quickly clogges up . I have gotten better results using a high quality pellet carbon . Dont waste your money on this crap"
2,"I've read the book. I've tried some of the drills. I've cut off a few strokes for every 25 yards. The ideas in this book make a lot of sense to me. I wish the author covered fly, back, and breast, too. Now, I need to see what my ""real"" swimmer friends think of the book."
1,"I have almost a complete set of dishware and bakeware in the Sango Blue. The items I received over a year ago were all of good quality and arrived in good condition. Sadly, there have been quality and breakage issues with my latest purchases. My casserole dish and lid arrived in one piece, but the lid has several obvious flaws in the glaze on the lid and so is not aesthetically pleasing. I have yet to try baking with it to see how it holds up to heat."
1,"I ordered this book primarily as a filler to get free shipping. As such, it did the trick perfectly. Otherwise the china dollis pretty bad. The doll is printed on cardboard, but the outfits, of which there are eight, are printed on paper similar in weight to copy paper. Nothing is perforated at all, making for substantial work cutting things out. This will not last more than a day or two. Sure, this is only $1.50, but I do not think it is even worth that."
1,"It was not clear from the ad that this product was made only for GameCube games played on the Wii; we wanted an Action Replay for Wii games. It took weeks to hear back from the vendor, and their 45% stocking fee made us not want to take another chance with them."
1,"First I had problems installing the game. If you have Windows 7, you need to get on the internet and download missing files for the game to even run. Nothing new or outstanding, but even on the easy setting, the advanced missions are impossible. Excitement runs out very quickly."
2,Is that sometimes people ignore the fact that this book is overwhelmingly depressing. But still an interesting style to read.
2,"I got this book after my classmates recommended it after passing the exam. This book helped me to pass the exam because it offers numerous practice exams, which offer questions and multiple answers that are framed just as the real exam questions are. It offers a practice exam to help you focus just on populations too. The questions are challenging enough, but not overly difficult as I have seen in other practice exam materials. For every question there are rationales explaining the right and wrong answers. It was very helpful and I recommend taking these practice exams shortly before the test."
1,"Horrible recording, a disaster.The voices are a shadow of noise, one cannot always hear what they sing because the voices are cluttered in a shadow of noise.The instruments are noise, one cannot hear the pitch and timbre. Something is there, but it sounds like ...what????More than 70% of what is sung cannot actually be understood for lack of sound detail.The instruments lack the detail of their sound and texture, you can't hear the notes for lack of pitch.One can see this is probably a good piece of music, but it's just wasted by such a bad recording.Way much worse than the mono recordings of the Beatles from 1961.A 40 year old cassette had better sound than this CD. That's how bad it is.My CD disc is made in ""Polo Industrial de Manaus, Brasil"", that's probably a hint."
2,CHUCK!! That's all I can think of on Monday night after a stressful day. I never missed an airing of Chuck since the stories and comedy mixed always pulls off one that leaves you satisfied everytime you watch it. I've seen many secret agent computer-tech turned into an agent themselves because of some accident or something happened to them. I have 4 boys in my family and we all enjoy Chuck every airing! CHUCK is a blast at comedy-action! SEASON 3 has got to air!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1 I couldn't live with out Chuck! I definitely will buy Season 2 blu-ray and give a set as a gift to someone for them to enjoy what I have come to love!
2,"Excellent book. Ivy is sweet and Ryder, so strong and dominant. Good book if you just want to relax and let go."
2,"This is a really great cd. All of girl repellent's songs are extremely catchy and has a great tune to it. When you listen to this cd, you cant help but sing along. I highly recommed this cd to anyone that likes pop-punk."
1,"I felt Cantrell's book was pretty much a waste of time. I've read a lot of books on Wicca and this one has nothing new to say. What it did have to say was kind of weak, and I have to agree with the other critical reviews here.But, take heart, there are some good books out there on Wicca. It's just that this isn't one of them."
2,"In this album we find an impressive blend of the simple but very captivating music of Umberto with the lyrics of Mogol (G. Rapetti), a real icon of the italian popular song, being the former ""other soul"" of Lucio Battisti in the golden era. There is a variety of ideas that is very good to hear yet not common and obviously this only comes after years of (good) work in this art. Beautiful work of art and the money is not waste. For a ""harder"" and more ""rock oriented"" pushing effect dig the former cd ""Il grido""!!"
2,"Another excellently detailed figure by 21st Century Toy Co. The detail is astounding right down to the bayonet clipping onto the barrel of his SDV Dragunov rifle. This is more for the grown up kid rather than little Timmy in the sandbox even though it can stand up to it. There are plenty of small detailed parts to loose, but that adds to it's apeal in a display case."
1,"I ordinarily like Stephen King, but he tends to get bogged down in details at times. This is one of those times. Leaving the extremely interesting story of Roland of Gilead and his current companions, King drags a story of lost love out WAY TOO LONG. Don't buy this--just skip to the next one, if it ever comes out."
1,"Well, after the first book of the Villains series. I had hoped that Mike Williams continue his streak of getting a little bit better... Unfortunately it was not met to be. This is the worst book in the series.. as opals are mentioned (again) but at a pathetic rate in this book and the adventure here is just not exciting and predictable... It's rather unfortunate since the Dark Queen is supposed to be the ultimate villain in Dragonlance. Not terrible... just not good. Average at best."
1,"The first word I said when I finished this book in one day since its only 126 pages was ""finally."" This was probabally the worst book anyone could ever read. Trust me, if your looking for a good read dont even look at this book. I know I might be harsh but, this book, quite frankly, Stinks. No facts, just a test that you would rather skip, then get an E, which I give this book, with an A+ being the best and and E, being the worst."
2,"I purchased this pool cleaner to replace a Kontiki cleaner that worked pretty well, but fell apart b/c I always left it in the pool (turns out that I can replace the part and keep it as a spare...if I need it!). I unplugged my old one and plugged diver Dan up to my old hose (kept the new hose in the box) and dropped him in, turned the pool on and sat and watched. My first thought was, man he is so slow! I gave up on watching him b/c it was like watching paint dry...lol. When I returned about an hour or 2 later I was amazed on how clean the pool was. Diver Dan moves really slow but picks up all the dirt without disrupting the surrounding areas and thus makes my pool far cleaner than my old creepy crawler style cleaner ever could. Diver Dan does occasionally get hung up in spots on the bottom, but he eventually turns out of it. My old creepy couldn't do that! I love Diver Dan, although we did rename him to Scuba Steve!"
1,"MY SCENE ARE SMELLY AND BRATZ ARE WAYYYYY BETTER. ANYWAY, WHEN YOU TAKE THE MY SCENE'S SHOES OFF, THEY HAVE TINY BARBIE FEET! THAT IS SOOOO SCARY. MY SCENE R CIPYCATS OF BRATZ, LOOK:MADISON=YASMIN AND FIANNAKENZIE=MEYGANCHELSEA= DANA, PHOEBE AND ROXXINOLEE=JADEBARBIE AND DELANCEY= CLOEMY SCENE SUK WHY DO YOU DUMB PEOPLE LIKE THEM? BRATZ DONT DRINK ALCOHOL!THATS ALL"
2,"My wife and I love to cook. We must have a dozen cutting boards, from the County Fair purchased flimsy plastic 24""x20"" monster to the tiny 5""x8"" poly to the heavy wood block beast (that we hardly ever use). By far, this is the first board we grab. The board does have a little bit of flex when chopping - the rubber side grips raise the board of the countertop just a wee bit.Pros: size allows for many sizes of prep jobs, rubber ends prevent sliding, built in liquid catcher groove thing (yeah, thats the technical term).Cons: none foundRecommendation: Buy today. Wait, buy two. Trust me."
2,"I am a long time fan of Classic Pooh, and my husband bought this for our son and myself to read together.We have probably read it 500 times since March! My son loves the pictures, and love to point out Pooh and Piglet, and all the other characters to grace this beautiful book.Also, the words are BIG,, a good first choice for when he is ready to learn to read on his own. Until then I will read it ten times a day! It's just as sweet as Piglet himself!"
1,"how can Easy E dis anyone? he had aids??? I dont want to dis someone who's dead, but look where Dre and Snoop are now, and look where he is....truth hurts and this album hurt my ears. Bone Thugs were the second best thing to come from Easy E, aside from N.W.A. Go buy a Bone thugs album and stay away from this trainwreck of an album."
1,"Definitely Maybe is my favourite album of all time, the album of my youth. Unfortunately Oasis are tarnisihing my youth by releasing drivel after drivel. Oasis used to sing about things people could relate to - boredom, being poor etc - what do you sing about when your millionaire celebrities - Hindu Times? How sad - clearly they are not religious in anyway - but John Lennon was - I'm getting a bit sick of their Beetle's worship.I want to look back on my youth and Oasis with fondness - so please stop buying their records and maybe they will go away."
1,"Both movies are a very good addition to any classic or horror movie collection. This disk, however, is not! The video transfer is supposedly ""restored"", but you would never know it. The Most Dangerous Game was watchable, but certain scenes were very washed out with lots of dirt and scratches. I had even worse success with The Vampire Bat. The movie started ok, but my DVD player actually had trouble reading the disk about mid-way through. It got so bad, that I had to stop watching the movie. If your main interest in this disk is, The Most Dangerous Game (by far the superior of the two films), then I suggest the Criterion release."
1,"I bought this DVD for my grandsons for Christmas. When they opened it to play it there was no DVD in it. It was sealed and never been opened so we couldn't figure out what had happened. Sorry it has taken me so long, they are in Colorado and we just remembered that I needed to writ to this seller."
1,"The book title is misleading. I thought it would be comprehensive, including scales, chords etc. However, too much of the book is devoted to extremely basic guitar questions, ie how to tune, clean and hold your guitar. Not enough material about playing the guitar."
1,"This is the only book that I had to read on my flight to Florida. I was trapped! I did not like or sympathize with any of the characters. Wait, yes I did, the dog. He was the only one who was real. Self centered garbage."
1,"Scottish author John Ward writes in a style common to occultist books. The language in THE SECRET OF THE ALCHEMIST is continental, some terms would doubtless be unfamiliar to most readers. There also is some vulgarity. I found hints of sexuality and depravity. In one scene, a woman is drugged, then her young daughter is stolen from her. She is doused with alcohol so that the police will think her a drunkard, and her story of her child's abduction to be merely the ranting of a street person.Though a book source I found said the book was for readers 9-12, I would not give this novel to anyone under the age of fourteen or fifteen. Even if they could wade through the obscure language and literary references, the overall dark tone of the book is not for younger readers. NOT RECOMMENDED. Caution for some language and adult content."
1,"If you want to read funny (and you read and understand Hungarian), then this book is for you. The recipes are sort of OK, but too simlified. The Hungarian titles are less then good impressions, so why bother? This little booklet covers about 0.1% of the Hungarian cooking. My advice to the authors: go to Hungary first and then try it again. Tamas Sarossy (Autentic Hungarian)"
1,"Product arrived in time for me to take on vacation; however, it is only the netting. NO HOOP or hanging hardware. The ad for this is misleading. I would never have purchased this w/o the hoop. I could have bought the mosquito net for far cheaper where I'm going. Won't do business with this vendor again."
1,I have read many of Anne Perry's books and enjoyed all of them until I read this mess. The characters are boring and the story is also. I got half way through it and decided it wasn't going to improve. I am sorry for readers who bought it and couldn't return it to the library! In a word I would describe it BOOOOORRRRRRIIINNNG!
1,"Strange how people consider this oi......what chant oi a couple of times, a few references to working and a lame cover of a cocksparrer song and you join the club? Not in my book. This cd is part of a generation of unoriginal dull street punk bands, e.g randumbs, patriot, bodies and pressure point playing strictly to the genre they have boxed themselves into. For Kansas City residents only."
2,So much fun. Very easy to make perfect snowballs. Works great even with dry flaky snow that normally wouldn't hold it's shape. Even my 3 year old can make (and throw) these snowballs. And the best part is that it keeps our hands dry. Will need to buy more and keep them on hand for Christmas presents next year.
1,"As with many Clarks Wallabees, one shoe was wider and longer than the other. They didn't feel very stable either. For quality, they are clearly seconds.I would have returned them if I had ordered them from amazon uk."
1,"Mariah Carey's single ""Heartbreaker"" my sound a little familiar. Ever hear of a song called ""Fantasy"" also by Mariah Carey? They sound like one and the same. What kind of an artist would re-mix their own song? And to have Jay-Z in this one is just too much. Mariah Carey is very overrated. Get yourself some new sounds and some decent clothes, Mariah!!"
2,This book was a non-stop read. I read it in two days! Very interesting and well written. I highly recommend this book.Karen
1,"I thought Champion brand == quality. Well, not so.The product is barely thicker than boxer shorts (that is, men's undergarments). OK, it is a little, but not much.Also, there are no pockets. Also #2, the ""silver grey"" is quite light; I wanted darker.I guess it's fine for the money... but I wanted something different.On a positive note, sizing is correct (I ordered a men's L)."
2,"Excellent conducting, wonderful Deborah Voight, and all other principles make for a gripping experience of this often ridiculed opera. The Cieca, Barnaba, Enzo, Alvize..all are superbly sung, and this is a very demanding opera on all voices..but here there is sheer beauty and high drama and high notes in all the designated places, not short tops with Deborah Voight, ever!Since Voght has lost so much weight, she acts with great force, and her voice now has those high notes, heretofore not focused at all.The sets are very sparse, but it really is the vocal drama that dominates this, and here it is very compelling.There are other versions, but this is the best, and there are CD versions to match..especially Callas' La Gioconda and Marton's on CBS. Avoid tat Umana one, but Placido Domingo is great.Buy this and revel in the romance and the vendetta and that blazinbg final scene..all there before you in tantalizing sound!"
1,"My daughter loves this game, but after installing the game, I realized that it had also decided to install some software from Gator.com.If you are not aware of what gator is, it is a massive online privacy violation. It will track all of your web travels, giving gator information that you have entered into webforms. This has nothing to do with the game, and is a blatant violation of your and your childs privacy.If I had a way to give this a lower rating I would. My daughter played for about 5 minutes before she ran into a hang that needed the computer rebooted, and we couldn't play anymore. Go somewhere else to find your childs games"
2,"I am not a fan of the pirates series. I saw the first two and they just didn't leave a lasting impression on me. The third movie on the other hand is the best one out of the three. The movie is action packed from beginning to end, keeps the original cast (good chemistry/acting), and similar to the previous two movies has some good humor in it. I guess the third movie in my opinion had a more interesting story than the first two. Another good thing is it is a movie that all ages can enjoy. The only complaint I would have about the movie is it is really long. Other than that, at world's end is a great ending to the series."
2,These replacement blades worked great when I needed to repair my AlienFly after flying it into the wall too many times!
2,"LOVE this pack n play. nice bright colors, great roomy size for bubs and an absolute breeze to set up and take down. takes literally 30 seconds! great value for money too. we were intitally given a second-hand one (used at our home business) and loved it so much we bought a second one for home.reason for only 4 stars - i just wish the floor had a little more padding. but after researching, this is the best play yard i could find."
2,All I can say is buy ALL the books in the series at one time! What a great read and what an enlightening way to get the message across. I know that I DO NOT want to be 'left behind'. The characters are great and you develop a relationship with them as you read each book. This series is one that you will lose sleep over ... just because you are staying up late reading!
2,This is one of the most powerful tapes every. Listening to it makes you feel like you are at Azusa. It is hard to keep the tears back as you let yourself go in the beauty of Worship.
1,"I've seen mixed reviews for this product, but I swear, I've tried it twice, and both times it seems the fleas doubled!! Like they like the stuff or something!"
1,"This is a bad movie, and no where near the book, since it leaves out the majority of what the book was based on, the characters and their stories. Also, alot is abridged overall, which leaves it feeling to rushed and tenuous throughout. It is like a long Twilight Zone episode more than a big movie or film. One thing for those who are not religious, you may be turned off by the constant ""God"" theme that runs throughout the film. Even for religious people, you may find it annoying - it feels to preachy to me. TOTALY SUCKED!!!!!!"
2,"Bought these Sleeves for my Pokemon Card collection. Comes with 100 sleeves in each pack, and is cheap but provides more durability for my cards that I dont use often.If your going to be using the cards in the sleeves often, I recommend getting toploaders or stronger sleeves. Great product overall, I highly recommend it. Was delivered before they said it would arrive, and was packaged very well. Fits my needs, and expectations."
2,"When America feared invasion from other worlds during the 1950s, this movie would scare the pants off you. America had yet to think of our voyage to Outer Space"
2,I've used this mouse daily (and nightly) for the last 18 months to two years and I find it to be an excellent mouse.
2,I have tried 5 out of the 7 so far and they really give me a workout. No confusing dance routines. I tried them for about 10 days and saw dramatic results. Jeanette will certainly challenge you and get you in shape. You should give it a try and you will see what I'm talking about.
2,"A must have if you were in High School in the 1980's. The music we heard on the radio, what we wore, etc."
1,"Having read so many great things about this book, I was very excited to get into it and really get working on verbs. I was also looking forward to being able to cart it around with all my other books via my Kindle.Unfortunately, like so many other language books, this one is not ported well. In fact, I would have to say it's worse than many others, as the tables are put together in image files which are too small to read, even when expanded.I'm still waiting for a publisher of this type of book to get serious about the Kindle and really translate their work over to a format that the reader can use."
2,"Even though I liked this book and found it humorous and even tender in parts, I had to question the spiritual aspect of the memoir. Finding out that John and Martha Beck were going to have a Down's Syndrome child, she had to battle everyone around her to continue the pregnancy.. Being ambitious and having Harvard degrees,many choices had to be made, especially reconsidering her frenetic, goal-oriented approach to life. Quips and hard-fought insights were many, but I found it difficult to swallow the belief she had in her son's angels and their out-of-body messages. I admit I am a skeptic of such things such as voices from heaven, but Beck's memoir kept me entertained throughout the book. Beck writes in a self-deprecating humor and you will be hooked from the first page of her memoir. Adam's birth was truly a rebirth of Martha Beck."
2,"I don't know how many people will read this since it has been 5 years(after release) but I felt I had to tell anyone who will listen that this is one of the BEST CDs of all time. I have never written a review on here before so know that this is not an emply compliment. I was a casual Slipknot fan before this cd. I liked a few of their older songs but didn't really get it. On a whim I bought this right when it came out not knowing what to expect. I still listen to this cd often to this day and have seen them in concert and purchased the older cds and have grown to appreciate the sound on all albums. This one is a little ""softer"" than others but still kicks a$$. In a perfect world the new cd will be a mix of this one and Iowa."
1,"I am surprised at the good reviews for this ""book"" (if you can call it that). And why is the last reviewer listed as a ""veteran teacher"" reviewing a substitute handbook? Hmmm. Anyway, I wanted to warn other subs to avoid this book. It is simple material that will either be covered in your sub orientation or is just common sense. Save your money."
1,"Over the last year I've gone thu most of the really good novels of this genre.A lot of my fantasy friends sold me on this book.Disappointing.The book was wrote for teenagers,or kids just about to be teens.It was a rehash of The Wheel Of Time.A bad one at that.Save your money, move on to something with more realistic relationships.The flow of the story was awful,hard to keep up with and then for pages nothing would happen."
1,"This movie was so overrated. The acting was awful, the direction slow. It single-handedly makes the war movies of the 1940s all look like Oscar material."
2,"I personally relate to the nature of the situation in which the author adeptly depicts a tragic event involving a couple's son. A traumatized child becomes trapped, not only in a grievious circumstance, but in an adult's body. The dysfunctional family dynamics associated with the adults' handling of the event are far too typical. I am convinced the author had first-hand knowledge, as I do. The boy who witnessed my son's death has a story that may never be told. I have found that telling the truth about such situations is enormously difficult and seldom done. Sometimes we just read about it in books like The Waterline, and we become more empathetic for all concerned. The author leaves no stone unturned as he examines the hearts and behaviors of a population at large who is not equipped to manage the emotions of tragedy. Well developed, easily visualized, intelligent, thoughtful and thought-provoking. A bit dark, but appropriately so."
1,"I have had two Lacie drives. Replaced the first and the next failed also. The drive has issues with either large files or large numbers of files. Could be overheating, seems to get very hot with plenty of ventilation. Who knows?Save your money, save your data. Life is too short. Avoid this brand."
2,"I ordered this after returning the monostrap pack because its padded computer compartment is way too small for my new Apple iBook. Unfortuately, the computer compartment that comes with this HUGE Back Office bag doesn't fit it either. However, I'll keep it and put the computer in the bag behind the compartment.Hopefully Amazon will take the iBook into consideration and adjust the computer compartment (make it expandable?)"
2,"Kinky Friedman and the Texas Jewboys are smart and funny and great to listen to. Songs like ""They Ain't Making Jews Like Jesus Anymore"" and ""Ballad of Charles Whitman,"" as well as the title track are great and insightful. A real pleasure."
2,"If you know anything about the hip-hop scene you already know of MF Doom aka Zev Love X aka King Geedorah aka Viktor Vaughn. You know what to expect from Doom, this album is no exception. This is not the BEST i've ever heard from doom by a longshot, but that is still 100 times better than most so-called mcs that so-called hip-hop listeners praise. Doom has a take it or leave it style, his lyrics & beats are only for true heads...and since when can you use too much sampling, someone please explain this...hip-hop was founded on sampling and pure original hip-hop beats like this with a raw, original flow like doom's. doom didn't disappoint me but he didn't blow me away either. definately worth a listen for true hip-hoppers though."
2,"I've owned this video since 1995, and I still go back to it often, because I haven't come across any other workout video that's quite this good. Karen Voight is a great motivator, and Elle's down-to-earth persona ensures that the home-exerciser isn't discouraged by her 'perfect' appearance. The video is divided into sections that interchange between aerobics and sculpting, so that no body part is neglected. The Hawaiian scenery is inspiring, and the music is well chosen (though now dated). I'd recommend this video to exercisers of all levels. Advanced exercisers can use heavier weights during the weights section, and beginners can slowly work their way up to completing the whole routine. It's an effective workout video that puts the fun back into exercising. Recommended for those that want to improve their fitness level, tone up or lose weight."
1,"I can not recommend this ""game"".... Probably beginners. It is so small (credit card size) than my husband laugh and refuse to play it."
2,DVD was jaw dropping.DVD arrived in a very timely fashion.DVD arrived in excellent condition.
1,"I keep on saying the best Lalo Schifrin is on his Jazz and soundtrack albums. He is specially a master in scenes of action on which he lays music with fresh movement, full of rhythm and harmonic insight, generally with the best orchestras and musicians in the place. 'Bullitt', 'Mannix', and 'Mission Impossible' are perfect examples of this.Now that Mr. Schifrin created his own label Aleph Records, these important soundtracks have seen the light of day in CD format. Very good!Unfortunately, 'The Amityville Horror' is a Schifrin's experiment in a series of terror ensembles with the same old clichés of this category. Sleepy!"
1,"After a week in Venice I wanted to live there forever. Picking up this book to read on the plane home, I hoped to see the city through other eyes and put my own dream into perspective. It starts well: the reader empathises with the Venetian disease Weinbereg catches. Half way through this book turns into a nasty diatribe against some Venetians and many expatriates. The author seems to think her closing section on a car-crash in Italy and its aftermath will make up for her bile. It doesn't, it won't.If I ever do live in Venice I fervently hope never to encounter this snobbish, garrulous and self-centered New Yorker. The book is not only a waste of money, but an offense to Venice and to readers. How on earth did this get published?"
2,"My daughter received Belle and Baby Ariel for her birthday and just loved them both so much. She received alot of gifts but these were her favorites, and she really can not wait to get Cinderella. She is asking for it for Christmas. All little girls will love these dolls."
2,"As a massage therapist, it is really tough to find appropriate music for a session. This CD hits the mark. No singing, chanting, or other distracting bird calls. Just pure melodious tunes that flow from one song to the other. My clients love this CD and you will too."
1,Magellan company I wish you bad things!received magellan gps last christmasfinally figured out there was something wrong with this thing in mayCalled the INDIANS was told reconditioned product 3 monthsMagellan you suck!1 year guarantee on new productsThe problem I have with their position isI thought a factory reconditioned produt would be checked out before reselling.I used this unit about 4 times as this technolgy is new to me a 59erI just bought a tom tom new for my daughter and suggest to others to stay away from magellan!!!
2,"This ice cream maker works just fine. I was a bit hesitant to buy it because of the other reviews, but now I'm glad I did. I've put in two cups of whole milk cherry vanilla jogurt with a little bit of cream and in 15-20 minutes I had a nice batch of frozen yogurt. Just make sure to chill it really well. I rate it 4 stars because of the high price."
1,"I WAS going to buy this. I've been waiting for it for a long time. However, I don't have any plans on buying the Theatrical version and then the EE. So I will just wait for the EE to come out"
1,This electric BP is not very good quality. I have an Avent manual pump which works much better. The suction is very poor and takes just as long if not longer than a manual pump.
2,"Michael Connelly hit a home run with this installment of Harry Bosch. This is his best book since the ""Poet."" I highly recommend it to all Connelly fans."
2,"I spent hundreds of dollars on salon products, Redken, KMS, Biolage, Nexxus. You name it, I tried it. My hair was constantly breaking and my color was fading (turning orange) even when I used the Color Extend products. I bleach my hair every 6 weeks at the salon and it is naturally dark brown so I need very deep conditioning. This stuff has worked wonders. After just 2 uses, my hair is sooooo soft, not breaking and is amazingly shiny. Don't believe that you have to buy salon products. This works 10 times better at about 1/3 of the price. Truly amazing."
2,"Don really pours feeling and passion into his music. His music is meaningful, clear, wonderfully performed and very soothing to listen to. This is not 'bang-your-head-against-the-wall' music. It is also not the Backstreet Boys. This is simply classic good-feeling music from a veteran of the music industry. A perfect album to have in the background at work during a stressful day. If you enjoy music to relax or work to, this is a great choice for you. I highly recommend the album."
1,"This book was a required reading in Bible College for the Poetical Books class.To better understand my review, I must first state that I am a very conservative, non legalistic Bible believing Christian.That being said, I would not recommend that anyone read this book or anything else written by Mr. Crabb. This book certainly does not esteem God's Word in an absolute manner and in my view promotes humanism. If my memory serves me correctly, Mr. Crabb even portrays our relationship with God as a sexual experience.I cannot browse this book again to write a more detailed review because I literally destroyed the book as I was reading it.I believe that Larry Crabb is false in his theology and views concerning God, humanity and the absolute nature of God's Word. This book is probably better accepted in more liberal theological circles."
2,"This CD has a lot of Dance-Pop and more club-oriented songs. Includes my favourite hit on here ""Arms Around the World"" by Lousie. The other songs are just as good. This pretty good compilation. The cover boys are real cute, too."
1,I bought it for my wife. She said it was too rough and harsh in all modes. Perhaps a foam cushion would help. We sent it back and have been waiting two weeks for the refund.
2,"I actually found Zombie 4 to be highly entertaining. Even morethan Zombi 3. Of course, as you may have expected, this movie dosent compare to Fulci's Zombie, Dawn of The Dead or any other highly regarded zombie flick. This one is a good movie to laugh at and have fun with. The effects are actually quite good, and for the budget it had, its amazing what they did with this one. Its not as bad as you may think. Im reccomending this for die hard horror movie/zombie movie fans who already have 10 or more zombie films in their collection.... but if you;re willing to give it a try, by all means... go ahead!"
1,"This latest version of Cuisinart's ""Oxford"" pattern, made in China, is far inferior to their earlier product in the same pattern. It's lighter, less solid feeling, less well made, with lots of minor flaws in the manufacturing. It's ok for the kitchen, but I would never use it for anything else. I feel sure it will not hold up well, will scratch more easily and look worn very quickly. Very disappointing, and not worth the price. -- B. Took"
2,"Finally, my dream come true. I've been expecting this release for a long time. I keep all the Columbo episodes on VHS and now it's great to know they're being released on DVD, hope it'll continue with all the seasons ahead. Robert Culp (Death lends a hand), Ross Martin (Suitable for framing), Jack Cassidy (Murder by the book),Roddy McDowell (Short fuse) and even Leslie Nielsen (Lady in waiting) are among the great actors that share the credits with Mr. Peter Falk (tip of the hat to him). Go for it, you won't regret it."
1,An admittedly dim bulb of a cat figured out in less than 2 days how to pop the doors up and get at the food. Well at least I got to sleep in ONE morning.....
2,je suis bien contente d'en avoir prix 2 (un pour le plancher et un pour le toit). Ainsi je peux laisser courir mes chinchillas sans craindre qu'il ronge quoi que ce soit ou il mange de l'herbe (dehors)ni qu'il s'échappe en dehors du parc.
2,After researching reel mowers and reading reviews I concur this is the greatest tool to mow a little grass! It arrived assembled; with only the handle needing attaching. No tools needed except a wrench to tighten up the bolts.t!Easy to push. Cuts well. Try it...you'll like it!
2,"Beautiful, deep book, and definitely one of my favourites of the ""Children of the last days"" collection... wonderful character insights, and beautiful imaginery..."
1,Five stars!. Excellent instructions for applique with pictures to demonstrate their words. Basic applique primer. Your resource book.
1,"I just recieved the TDK Professional Lens Cleaner (2box) and it does not work. I have 3 dvd players and in all of them it does not read the disk. It says loading or read, then says no disc or error. I did contact the TDK live help line and they were not helpful except to say that I should exchange it. I may be a bad cd but it was brand new and very expensive. I would choose another more inexpensive one if you buy online due to the hassle of exchanging items."
2,"I think this movie may have just moved up to one of my favorites. I saw it in the theater and counted the days until I could buy it. For those of you who read the book - watch the movie, it is just as good if not better. And even if you didnt read the book, the movie will make you want to."
2,"As I said in the title, this is the best ever film-version of a Dickens novel. Oliver Twist expertly tells the story of this enormous novel in less than two hours' screen time. We start with baby Oliver left on the doorstep of an orphanage by his unwed mother. Proving a difficult charge to the wicked orphanage official, Oliver is sold into a job as an undertaker's apprentice. He then runs away and joins a gang of street urchins, led by master pickpocket Fagin . Oliver is rescued from this life; but, with the help of Bill Sikes, Fagin abducts Oliver. Sikes' girl friend Nancy does all she can to restores Oliver to his home. This leads to Oliver going home, but to her death."
2,"This was a gold box deal for the day at 32.00 including shipping, This ottoman set was a great bargain! I'm using it as an end table next to the couch in our den. The soft top is stable enough to put drinks on without flipping it over to a tray. I really like these and am glad that I purchased it!I didn't have any problems with the smell like some other reviewers, I didn't notice any smell when unwrapping the package."
2,I have three different kinds of Eheim filters and this one for the price is the best of the three that I use. It is easy to set up and also simple to maintain. I would suggest this filter for the beginner or for someone who is looking to set up a 60 gallon aquarium. Eheim filters are very well constructed and have a solid reputation in the aquarist community. I will only use Eheim filters from now on.
2,"I've heard the term ""transformation"" (whether instantaneous or not) many times in my career. After reading ""WOYDW"" this is the first time in my life where I actually ""get it"". This amazingly inspiring little book did more for me that all the years of work I had done in the past to try and ""fix"" myself. Who would have thought how powerful being in the moment could be? I have already bought this book three times as a gift for friends. And what a gift it is! As a musician and music teacher, I find this book to be essential reading material. Thank you Ariel and Shya Kane!"
1,"I was really excited to find this product at a good price. It would have been perfect, five stars, if the magnets were strong enough. I placed it on a metal cabinet that had been painted white, and while it stuck to it, the magnets slid right down the cabinet everytime I pulled a paper towel off.Then I tried it on my refrigerator. It is NOT a stainless steel refrigerator, which I understand have problems with all types of magnets sticking on them. My refrigerator has a very, very slight texture to it and again the magnets stuck but then slid right down the refrigerator everytime I pulled a paper towel off.So that tells me that it must work only on plain, unpainted, perfectly smooth metal, which makes it useless to me.Again, if the magnets were stronger so that it wouldn't slide down everytime I pull a paper towel off, I would have given it five stars."
2,"I have seen Peter Blanchette twice now. The first time, I bought his CD, ""The Broken Style"", which is my favorite (as first purchases of artist's CDs will usually be), and when I saw him a second time I bought this one. This is a great recording to relax to. It's great just when you want to work without the distraction of words, yet will still focus you and let your imagination wander to another time. It's a great collection."
2,"Sylvia Browne paints a very vivid picture of how everything looks on the other side, buildings, statues, hobbies and more. She also tells how things work when you cross over. What processes you go through before and after coming to this world. I guess we won't know for sure if she's right until we all cross over. But it is a very good book that I couldn't put down. It made me want to get hypnotized to see what my subconscious knows."
1,"I returned these for headphones that are actually built for humans. I ran about 10 steps with these on and they started to fall off. These would be great if you had nothing else to do with your hands except hold them on your ears. If you couldn't figure out, I rate fitment a 1. Overall sound would be much better if you stuck your head in a vice to keep pressure on both ears. Found retractable cord nice, but too sensitive, with any kind of movement it tends to retract randomly without pushing the buttons. Stylish yes, functional absolutely NOT!!!"
1,"This book is composed of somewhat random stories of events in the British Navy. It is in no way a history. It is not bad, but the title is very misleading."
1,"I love the movie that was made based on this book so I had very high hopes for the book. Unfortunately, I was devastated to find that the author doesn't know how to write a book. She jumps all over the place, with a lot of ""remembering back"" moments. Now I know why the movie was made to be so different from the book. They are hardly the same in any way other than the very basic story line involving the Editor in Chief of a major magazine that is bossy and demanding. Seriously, I would save your two cents on buying this book if I were you."
1,"The Nudes Volume I had some really good unseen pictures, with many incredible nudes. This second book should never have been made. The photos are terrible, and the pictures are nothing compared to the first book. If your looking for nudes to study, this book is not the book to get. If you just want every book out there with nudes, then buy it."
1,Elastic velcro strip difficult to keep in place. .Would also have liked ability to remove one of the two supports- for singular hernia.
1,"Man, Good Charlotte SUCKS!!! I heard them when I bought my Now 18 copy. They sound JUST LIKE SIMPLE PLAN AND BLINK-182!!! Along with other similar crappy, untalented bands. This sucks! Definitely don't buy this. Get some Nine Inch Nails or Chevelle for a much better Alt. Rock CD. And Van Halen and AC/DC for your oldies (I like recent stuff better...idk why, just do)."
2,This book has been very helpful to me. I think anyone who has Interstitial Cystitis would benefit from reading it. It would also be helpful if you have a family member with this illness so you can understand what they go through.
2,"I've been a huge fan of this group since high school.I had all their albums on vinyl,tape,and most of them on CD.They are a legendary group.I'm 60 years old now,probably they are too.All of their albums are reasonably priced except this one.It's an awesome album,that I'd love to own.But the price is ridiculous.I'd never pay $100.00 dollars for any album.Bring the price down to a reasonable amount of $15-$20,and I'll buy it.Even a bonafide collector isn't stupid enough to pay the price your site has on it.We live in tough economic times.Give the public's wallet a break."
2,"I enjoyed this book, especially the setting and main character. I have always had an interest in Medieval England, and a mystery set there was a treat. That said, the mystery part was a bit of a let-down, and I smelled a set-up at the end for a sequel. I guessed right away how the book would conclude, but kept reading in the hopes that something else would be thrown at me. Maybe this book was a practice swipe at becoming a great mystery writer, maybe not..., nevertheless, pick up one of Sharon Kay Penman's earlier works - you won't be disappointed"
1,"...if you enjoyed Misty's and Reesy's antics in ""Scenes from a Sistah"" and ""Gettin' to the Good Part"" you'll love ""Tastes Like Chicken"".The story picks up with Reesy preparing to get married. Only a ""surprise"" guest shows up at the wedding and the nuptials are halted. This is where the drama begins...the story revolves around Reesy who embarks on a trip across county to get away from the madness, Misty and Reesy's parents.I loved the book...my only complaint is to Ms. Files. Don't leave us waiting several years for a sequel. We tend to forget the essential pieces to the story."
2,"It's big, it's a thermometer, and it has a clock. Nothing fancy, and it does the job. I wish the clock portion was a little bigger though, as it's a little difficult to tell the time since it's so small. Seems to work good so far. I have it mounted underneath my deck (the deck is on the 2nd story) so it's in the shade to give a more accurate estimate of the outside air temperature. Don't forget to buy a battery for it. I believe it took 1 AA battery (not included.)"
1,"Overall, the cable does it job, but the constant sound drops/pops you hear while listening to music is irritating. I know none of you wouldn't want to be listening to music then all of a sudden you hear a small disturbance in your music. It's just really irritating because it doesn't stop. These cables look like Belkin replicas so be careful when purchasing them."
1,"First I just felt let down that this book didn't have George's regular characters. But as I started reading, I just felt sad and horrible. I couldn't even finish this. It was just unremitting, depressing, bad things happening to children. If George wanted to write a social commentary on the relationship between crime and poverty, she's certainly free too. But the book should have been marked as such. It didn't belong on the shelf with her other mysteries."
1,"I bought this product a few months ago and honestly I should have listened to some of the reviews. This does not give you a cardio workout if you are already in shape. It does however, work the leg muscles and keeps them toned. I needed for the winter and I will probally be getting rid of it.The quaulty is poor as well. The clock that keeps track of distance etc., never worked from day 1. It is also ver noisy now and it has only been about 3 months.This product is more for people who just need to get moving, not for those who consider themselves inshape. I don't think I have sweated once using it and I rev it up in attempt to make the workout worth it."
1,"I finished the Club Dumas and I'm wondering why anyone cares. The plot is ridiculous. Some greedy and somewhat sleazy book merchant chases all over the Iberian peninsula and France for two books that will supposedly summon the Devil while a bunch of Eurosnobs plot to keep a handwritten chapter of a Dumas book from public scrutiny - all the while belonging to a club that reprints ancient dime novels? Minute details about book collecting overwhelmed me with tears of boredom. There's the stereotypical fetching young woman who all we know about is that she uses a name from a Sherlock Holmes story and is a kick boxer of some talent because she can beat up an actor? Meanwhile, the evil ""pay no attention to the man behind the curtains"" guy surfaces only briefly at beginning an end. And if I read the word ""apocryphal"" one more time I would have puked. The ending, especially the last page, is so trite I would have expected it to come from a John Grisham novel. And I LIKE John Grisham."
1,"You can not learn Java out of this book. The authors did good job in C and C++ books but not in this Java book, I read also the laboratory book that one also very weak I recommend Introduction to Java Programming by Y. Daniel Liang"
1,"I received this item and three weeks later it did not work. The reset button kept going off. I contacted Amazon.com they put me in contact with the seller, I returned the item per their request. I am still waiting for a replacement which they tell me is out of stock.When the fan worked, it did a nice job."
1,"After spending about 3 weeks going over all parts of this book, I find it lacking in too many areas. There are just too many errors, too much misleading information, poorly worded questions and contradictory information. I reached a point where I feel I cannot trust this book to adequately prepare for any of the tests. One would think that by the third edition the book would have been profread enough the catch all the mistakes."
2,"I was not familiar with BNL til ""One Week"" and I found that song mildly interesting when it first came out, but it quickly got overplayed enough to be really annoying. Then I heard ""It's All Been Done"" and I thought, who has been holding out on me? Why haven't I heard great stuff like this before? Since then I have been checking out some of their other music from friends who are into them. They have lots of good songs ($1,000,000 is great!) but this is the best. I love the singers' voices, the excellent musicianship, and the weird, ironic humor of their lyrics. This is one of 1999's best!"
2,"If you liked Rule of Four and the DaVinci Code, you'll love The Club Dumas."
1,"I can't say that this is ATB's most stellar work. He's a great DJ, don't get me wrong, but the song choice for this CD isn't the best I've heard. It is also on the cheesy side of techno, which ATB tends to go for. If you like cheesy techno add another star to my review and go listen to it. Otherwise save your money."
2,"Very large and comfortable. My dogs come up on it and snuggle with me. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because by the end of the season a couple of the stringers had frayed and broken, but it was still sturdy enough to continue using. I did leave it out all the time though so it did withstand severe Florida elements. Hot, hot days, rain, my sprinkler system, etc. So if you took better care of it than I did, it would probably last better."
1,"I checked this book out of the library and like the clear exposition, so I decided to buy a copy.What was delivered was the copyright 2010 ""corrected""? version, and the print quality is very bad: very light type which is not easy to read."
2,"Before my pregnancy, I hated exercise. I would start a routine then abandon it within a week. Maybe it's the fact that getting my body back into shape post pregnancy is so important to me, but I absolutely love this video! I started after my six week check up and each segment has three different ability levels which makes it really great. Lindsay is fun to watch, her enthusiasm and excitement is really motivating. I actually look forward to my workouts now. I am definitely going to check out some of her other videos."
1,"I've searched through the reviews and I can't understand how nobody else is commenting on the fact that a blue line scrolls up the screen at just after the 49 minute mark when we first see Loki as king. I've gone through 5 different copies of this blu ray combo pack, from two different vendors, and all of them have the same issue at exactly the same spot. I've tried both the blu ray and the DVD and I've tried playing both on different blu ray players and with different TVs and that annoying blue line is there in every scenario. I'm really hoping that this issue will be fixed because I think the movie is excellent and I can't wait to own an copy that isn't flawed."
2,I really wanted this story to have another 5 chapters at least--I want to know what happens as these people renew their intertwined past and maybe join forces as a renewed family.
1,"If a 5 is a great item this would be a -5... The design is great but the plastic will not bend to take a standard clay pigeons (had three different boxes) without shattering it. I would not waste my time purchasing this.Note, I was trying to use this outside in about 35 degree weather but that should not matter whatsoever.I returned the item..."
1,"A few things to begin:1: I know this was the only SW novel in 78.2: How did this author win any SF award?So, I read through this book and by page 83 was convinced that Leia and Luke were two little children who constantly bickered and would lack the intellect not to get into a mud fight in the precarious situation they were in.THIS book is utterly unbelievable. I thought I was sitting in on a 1978 D&D; game!The writing is impossibly immature. Along with petty infighting and Leia's YOU KNOW WHO I AM lines (like that is going to scare big burly miners on an imperial controlled planet????) mixed with a few WORDY paragraphs and that just about sums up this novel.AVOID THIS NOVEL if this is your first venture into the expanded universe! Not all the SW novels are great ore even good, but the worst of the post 78 novels make this novel look like a bedtime story written by a child."
1,"C'mon, guys...Five star...If you die-hhhhard fan of Iron Maiden, maybe...But, please, don't force the rest of good metal fans to buy this ""masterpiece"". Thanks God, one of my friend of mine has bought this CD and I had a chance to listen to it. It saved my money. Flat, boring, monotonous, grey...Bruce's solo albums are much more better. Honestly speaking, I've never been the group fan and always supposed it is ""shade of Deep Purple"", literally, though some albums were really good crafted. But this album just is shade of Iron's classical albums. I've mentioned I'm not die-hard fan, but couple of my friends are, and they've got the same opinion: the ""brand new world"" is so terrible that we'd rather stay in our good old one!"
2,"This is really a great book for an in depth architetural and archeoligical review of the Vijayanagara site... It does a great job reviewing and descriping some of the pertinent buildings to this study. A little light on pictures, though, and probably pretty heavy for the casual student."
1,"What was delivered to me I think it's not brand new, it's not working as it supposed to do."
2,Wagonmaster is the best ever album Porter Wagoner has ever made. The greatest thing would be to learn Marty Stuart archived additional tracks and conversation to create a follow-up album.
1,"I've been using indoor tanning lotions, pretty consistently, for about 10 years and Swedish Beauty has always been my very favorite brand. I've tried numerous lotions of theirs and Chocolate Indulgence is by far my least favorite. It's thicker than most and the smell is terrible! You definitely don't want to use this unless you can shower right away - in addition to smelling bad, the smell seems to get worse after tanning. I go to an awesome salon and with their beds normally see a difference in my tan the day of my tanning session - not with this lotion. The only use I can see for this product is maybe as a pre-tan moisturizer if your skin is very dry. I have had much better results tanning using lotions without bronzers from SB. My current favorites from SB are Priceless and Bronze Beauty - pretty much the same lotion but Priceless is from their blush line. Both of those work great!!"
2,I found this book to be a solid read. The characters were well developed and the story flowed very well. I am not surprised after reading that this made Oprah's book club list. If you are a fan of her type of novels (I find all the Oprah's book club book's have a similar theme) you will enjoy this novel.
2,"If you are a fan of Marshall Crenshaw, you'll love listening to this CD of his favorite demo tapes. We like to put this CD on while we are lounging around the pool. It's fun to imagine that Marshall is out in our garage playing and practicing. This music is light-hearted, soul-warming, and just really great rock-n-roll. Phil Wilkerson, Naples, Florida."
1,"I bought a Toshiba because of its supposed quality name. Unfortunately, I was led astray. The dvd/vcr 291 hummed and buzzed loudly when I hooked it up. Then, when I tried to record a tv program, the resulting picture rolled and jumped so much that no amount of adjusting would fix it. I returned it to Best Buy and they exchanged it for a Samsung, no questions asked.Besides the terrible recording, I struggled through the remote's instructions with its multitude of buttons. I'm no idiot, but after an hour trying to figure out which buttons did what, I began blathering like one.So, avoid this piece of junk."
2,"This work is pure genius. I fell in love ith the characters immediately, and the series only gets better. A rare find . . . Quite a treasure."
2,"Dispatch, formerly One Fell Swoop, are an amazing trio of musicians who bring the FUNK to the stage. I've had the pleasure of seeing them numerous times in Boston and the New England area, and during the hiatus of Phish, Dispatch has filled a void with surprising funk and finesse! I haven't yet seen this DVD, but have been following the setbacks of it's release for the past six months, and am stoked to pick it up tomorrow, as no doubt, it will be bomb! Show this downhome, funky, good-time lovin' band some love, and spend the 20 bucks on this DVD! You will be rewarded in the viewing! PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST!"
2,"Definitely the best tool out there for the size and price. This has everything yu could possibly need, regardless of what you ride. I myself use a Catrike 700, and this is perfect for me. But it would work great on any bike or trike!"
1,Do not encourage Lucas by putting more dollars in his pocket. We are the fans who gave him our hard earned money that made him the gazillionaire he is today. There is no conceivable logic for him not to preserve the original versions other than all that money has made him insane. Please do not give him any more money. He obviously does not respect you for it.
1,"I loved the design of this scanner and needed to be able to scan both large items and negatives. Unfortunately, the scanner doesn't work properly. Negatives come out greenish yellow where there should be blue; light colored pictures come out with banding -- dark and light bands across the picture. Tech support seemed very aware of both problems and told me to return the scanner to the store where I bought it. Both phone and email support did not indicate that there was any fix for these problems. Too bad, as I really wanted this scanner. I hope HP fixes the problem; if they do, I'll buy it again."
1,"This movie is lacking in several ways. The story is not compelling at all. It shifts from the reality of a novelist in marriage woes to the adventure story that he's working on. It would have been better as a straight adventure film, or perhaps as a romantic story. The martial arts and special effects are poor. I prefer Jet Li in Kung Fu Master. The story doesn't make any sense, but the fight scenes are terrific in Kung Fu Master. I was not entertained by this film."
1,This is by far the worst wolverine in the marvel legends edition. The only good thing about this figure is its most accurate to scale in comparison to all other wolverines created. This character is the least wanted in the marvel legends series and for the little effort put into making him.If you're gonna make another version of wolverine make sure it proceeds the last not vice versa.
2,"I was diagnosed with Osteopenia several years ago and I could not reverse it while taking MRM Bone Maximizer III.Since I hate to take a bunch of capsules I looked around for something that had all the trace minerals you need in it. I found one but there was something in it I was allergic to.I searched for one capsule that had all the Trace Minerals I would need to add to my Calcium/Magnesium regimen and this fit the bill.I take one capsule a day and finally for the first time I finally got my osteopenia to reverse some.I'm sure it's a combination of what I've been taking but if you have a lot of sensitivities to things like me, you have to take more things to eliminate problems.I really like this. And the capsules are not too big so that is great too.And the price here is great. I wish they would put it on subscribe and save."
2,"To be honest, this is a great book! very vivid, and I cried at some parts. I could see a few of my friends as the people in the book, as I have friends that are Anorexic, 'Emo', very over weight, etc.Only problem I had with it, was the fact that though it was an amazing book, it wasn't extremely deep and in with the whole situation. But then again, what do you expect from a fiction book? I recommend getting this from a library, then if you love it, buying it here. Hope this helps you out :) Happy reading!"
1,"Two stars is being generous. Completely derivative, unmemorable wannabe pop rock. ""Golden Touch"" is a decent song, hence my (unfortunate) purchase of this release many moons ago. If you are relatively new to music, I would recommend you not to buy this, but if you are curious and do buy it, be safe in the knowledge that there is far greater stuff out there waiting for you."
2,"Works well, no problems and it is VERY handy to have around. I use in when traveling so I only need one cord to charge my cellphone."
2,Bought this bag for my son for Christmas and he said it's awsome..he does a lot of camping and should last him many year's..well made and WARM !
2,"I think Ms. Lowell will always be one of my favorite authors. Both her first book, (WHEN THE STORM BREAKS) and this book, are the best well-written romantic suspense novels, in my opinion. I like her books because they are detailed with excellent plots and strong lead characters. As you read, you can't put them down and Ms Lowell gives her books just the right amount of chapters, to keep you enthralled for more than a day or two. I loved it, and I can't wait for the next book."
1,These puzzles were just too hard. You'd have to be a Jeopardy or trivial pursuit master to answer these puzzles.
2,"I did not think that I would ever buy a physical dictionary again, but returning to college has prompted this purchase. I love the convenience, not having to turn on my computer every time I want to look up the spelling or definition of a word. The price was also incredible. It does come with the entire dictionary on CD-ROM, which includes a thesaurus as well. An excellent value!"
2,"This product is great for the occasional snack, or extra side dish with dinner.The scooper, however, was a little skimpy (handle not long enough), but now I'm looking for a ""spider"" to use with it.Especially loved that you can just cover it, and re-use oil.Great product."
1,"Received promptly,but the cable connection on the suppressor is defective. Would send it back,but can use it on a location that does't require a cable input."
1,"I was told this item was a must have when my older child was born (now three) and it was. We used it every night for two years and would have used it longer but there was no way to attach it to a bed. While in storage the water evaporated so when my second child was born I got the ""new and improved"" model . . . yuck!! The lights are brighter and the music is not a pleasant and soothing. The worst thing is the new design with the battery compartment as a separate piece that is clunky and doesn't always keep a good connection. If you touch the item or the crib the music goes off - very annoying. I was very disappointed by the remodeled version and would strongly recommend you find the older model if you can."
2,"This is an excellent booster. We originally saw someone at a diner with this chair and thought that it would be to bulky to carry place to place. But after waiting longer when going out to eat for a high chair to be available and then the high chair being dirty most of the time we thought we would give it another look.We take the booster chair everywhere especially when we go out to eat. I allows my son to have a clean environment to sit in as well as a tray to eat on. The tray is even small enough that on vacation you can take it to the restroom and wash it in the sink.Being a pedi nurse, I know how easy it is for kids to catch something from the kid that was there before so I love this chair. I feel better knowing his isn't going to try and chew on the table as most kids do as well as not having to buy the disposable placemats so he could have somewhere clean to eat.This chair is a must have!"
2,if you liked SG-1 then you are going to like this tie into the series. With good whitty humor and awesome space battles. It also has a good transfer rate from DVD to BluRay.
1,"I liked my last Taylor mini-maxi thermometer, so, when I needed one for my new greenhouse, I bought a Taylor again. This one has bad design (you are forced to grip it in such a way as to put pressure on the tube, easily pushing it out of the plastic retaining clips). The long vertical red button, supposedly for resetting, doesn't work. It has never worked. The magnet is difficult to get out of its storage space. One of the two black markers is now permanently stuck down in the mercury, and does not budge in response to the magnet. It would be hard to find a way to make a more worthless thermometer for those who need to know minimum and maximum temperatures over a 24-hour period."
2,"I have had this book in my occult library for a number of years,and I have to admit two things. When the weather is cold, wet andspooky outside, this is one of the books I seem to be alwaysreaching for. Ok that doesn't sound that magickal,but,in actuality, mood is a critical element of real magick. Secondly,there are a number of interesting sigils in this book, and I onceconjured the king Bael using this book,in a very interesting conjuration to visible form, so the sigils work pretty good. I also like the illustrations, back again to that ""old black magick"" feeling, I suppose."
1,"Terrible. Absolutely terrible, specially considering how expensive it is. Behind a beautiful design and a solid aluminum construction hides a truly awful controllers, and even worse drives. Not to mention how slow and noisy it was.In my case, this drive crashed fatally several times, losing all the data in them. Terrible if you work for a living with your computer, and highly depend on it to survive. The third time it happened, I decided to sell it, second hand. Unfortunately, I was never able to sell my Lacie drive as the power input literally started burning, releasing a plume of smoke, and the smell of an electrical plastic burn permeated my office.If I learned something from this experience was to never buy Lacie. Ever. I should have learned my lesson the first time around, five years ago, when I bought a Lacie D2 that literally lasted me 1 month before it crashed and destroyed irreparably all my data. Now for good, never again."
1,"The concept is great but needs to be improved upon. The part that you lay on constantly wrinkles, bunches up, and shifts around b/c there's nothing keeping it laying flat while your bodies are naturally moving on top of it. It gets realy uncomfortable having the material bunch up under you and you need to keep fixing and adjusting it. I'm disappointed since there are very few of these types of items available for bedsharing with our infant. I wish the sheet part was longer so that it could be tucked under the other side of the mattress or something - that way, maybe it would stay put."
1,"To summarize what everyone else pointed out but I ignored:* this unit runs very very hot* this unit just stops working every few days and requires a full restart which _may_ make it work again.Don't get it. You'll worry in the back of your mind about the heat, and you'll be irritated with the constant reboots."
1,"I enjoyed reading the book, but I'm very disappointed that I didn't get the cover art when I purchased this book for my Kindle. It was light buying the new book at a book store, but before the cashier gave me my book had ripped off the cover, yet charged me full price for the damaged book. It's like the publisher didn't bother to include the cover image and didn't care whether readers wanted the cover image or not, since it's a digitatl copy of the book. Not having the cover reduced my enjoyment of the book."
1,The lid is very difficult to put on. It is a trick to get the lid properly closed without spilling the water. I have had other microwave rice cookers that were great - this one isn't. I never cooked in it due to the frustration with the lid.
1,"I got this book for my birthday, glancing through the pages it seemed full of exciting projects to build. My enthusiasm wore off once I started building the projects. Although most of the parts in the ""Bill of Materials"" are easy to obtain there are some _critical_ parts required for the completion of the project. The book contains vague descriptions of arcane parts that can only be obtained through the authors web site. Alas, overpriced in my opinion. A good book in my opinion wold list part numbers and various sources so the reader has a choice. I have found the cost ""estimates"" ridiculous, in a particular project just two of the ""special"" parts needed are more than the ""estimate"" for the full project. Not to mention that you can only get them through the authors website. In my opinion one of the reviewers that called this book ""an infomercial"" for the authors website was right on.Thank you for reading."
2,"the song major players is very good, it is a OK CDMEAN GREEN WAS A VERY GODD PRODUCER AND YOU HAVE A LOT OF THE SOULJAS ON THE CD.CHECK OUT TRU - THE TRUTH IF YOU WANT A MORE RECENT NO LIMIT CD."
1,"Being an American classic, we decided to purchase this product. Unfortunately, we find it to be a terrible product. Although 2 children can comfortably sit, that's as far the use goes. The handle being very rigid, the wagon won't go under the boot of a car, so you can forget about taking it to a nearby park for a stroll. We stay upstairs, and its quite heavy to it lift it over the stairs. So we use it mostly inside home. Also, the plastics are cheaply made.Frankly, I am not sure how this company lasted for 100 years. I would have assumed a 100-year-old company to have addressed these basic usability issues. What a waste of space in our home."
1,The remote is horrible as you have to point it directly at the DVD player and press the buttons multiple times to get it to work. The remote also lacks a open/close button which I thought was fairly standard.The DVD player itself is less than adequate. I can think of at least 3-4 times since I bought it that it has frozen and not played a DVD. I am not talking burned or damaged DVD's...I put them in my other DVD player and my X-box and they work just fine. What is equally annoying is the fact that it freezes the controls on the dvd player so I have to reach around my entertainment center to unplug it each time it decides to be tempormental. I will never buy a Philips again.
1,"I don't know if I just got a lemon or what, but I bought this brand new and have had nothing but issues. If I try to put more than 160 songs on it, it will not turn on (it would just flash iAudio over and over). Since I bought this 2GB purposefully so I could have up to 500 songs, I promptly returned this piece of crap 3 days later. It also froze sometimes when I tried to unhook it from my computer, and I had to take the battery out to make it reboot. This could be an individual unit issue, but I'm not taking any more chances with this brand. Also, they say Mac compatible, but what they really mean is that it won't break if you plug it into your Mac. The software it comes with is definitely not compatible, but you can drag and drop from iTunes. Hope this helps!"
1,"All I have to say is that I bought this for my friend, he dropped it once, and it broke. And it wouldnt turn back on. We tried everything. Horrible product, please dont buy."
2,"When I originally purchased this ""Junior Classic"" - as a gift for my little brother, an Arthur aficianado - I didn't expect to enjoy it much myself. However, the adaptation is well-done, and is not so inane as to make it unbearable to anyone over ten, which is what I expected. I was so pleasantly surprised that I went out and bought myself a copy!British actor Sean Bean has an incredible range of voices and accents, which he uses impeccably to enrich the characters he reads (though all the narrative is done in his lovely native Yorkshire). Morgana le Fay, Lancelot, Elaine, and, yes, Arthur all come to life as one listens. A very enjoyable audiobook, for bedtime or listening to in the car, or just as a mini-holiday!"
2,I recently purchased this pore cleanser mainly for my 14 yr old to use since she has a problem with blackheads. I decided to try it out first so I could show her how to use it properly. I was disgusted yet fascinated by the amount of goo it sucked off my face. My daughter had a similar experience. Both our noses looked better the next morning. Her blackhead count was visibly lessened. The only suggestion I would have for panasonic is to figure out a way to make the mist warm water. It seems counterproductive to me to spray cold water on the face thus closing the very pores you are trying to clean. The mist is also a little messy but I understand why it is necessary. I would say that this is worth the money and you should give it a try.
1,"Great to look at -- in the tradition of Eraserhead or Freaks.But that's the troublesome aspect. It's mostly aesthetics, with a great backup score.Very little information, almost no social consciousness -- one would think it had been made decades ago. Singer objectifies the people in front of the lens shamelessly. Or perhaps he is just woefully behind the times and didn't know what he was doing. I would hope that was the case. But if you just want to see a good looking black and white film, it's got some great shots."
2,"This brush is amazing. If you have a dog that sheds a lot, this is the tool to buy. Worth every penny. Shipped fast and works like magic."
2,"Hey Everyone!! Just wanted to fill you Folks in and tell you that this CD is even better then the first.. Most Imports don't rank that High but I give this a 11 out of 10.. If your like me you feel sorta scared on weather you want to purchase imports or not.. But, I Promise you this time you wont be disappointed! To me it even sounds better then the Origanal Thong Song.."
1,"There is very little that is startling about ""By the Way"". It all sounds horribly familiar. Much as Soundgarden, Chris Cornell, Rage Against the Machine, God where does the list end, ""By the Way"" bothers me so much because they seem to have all signed some sort of music industry pact to make bland, radio driven crappy music and you idiots just eat it up."
2,"I've been using my toshiba for 4 months now, and I believe its a great model out there in the PDA market. Packed with Pocket PC 2002 OS, the e310 is thin and lightweight, copared to other pocket pc's out there.The pocket pc 2002 OS is far much better than the latest Palm OS. As you may know, it comes loaded with tons of software, familiar in the regular Windows environment.Pros.- Size, weight- Crisp Screen, good speaker- Fast processor- A whole bunch of applications to useCons- It tends to crash sometimes, (erases all info, very annoying)- Only 32MB (although SD expandable)- Battery doesn't last as much as other PDA'sMy verdict:- For this price, excellent choice. (thats the reason for five stars)"
1,I am sorry I didn't discover this season to be defective until it was too late. I ordered the entire 8 seasons and didn't get to viewing this right away. It seems to be produced by another company and is inferior to the other seasons. It skips and stick and in general doesn't play well. Buyer Beware! I would order another replacement but I feel it would be the same poor quality!
1,"I've been bouncing from one alternative deodorant to the next for several months now with mild success. The Anthony Logistics alcohol-free deodorant was attractive for its lack of aluminum as an ingredient. Through the initial use I did find that my underarms could tolerate the formula. Other brands have produced adverse skin reactions. Unfortunately, the lackluster performance of the deodorant to actively control and/or eliminate body odor was not encouraging. I could get through midday without any perceptible smell, but after lunch this product would not continue to work as desired. Sadly, I am trying to use up the stick by only applying it when not in the workplace (i.e. weekends). Your mileage with this product may vary. For what it's worth, I will not be purchasing this product again."
2,The music on this CD is really nice. It is worth getting for any fan of Final Fantasy.
2,good this product was a very successfully thing and i really did enjoy the way it helps me. It is something else.
1,"With the stellar cast, I thought it would be good. This movie is a composite of everything horrible and ugly about our society. Did not finish, would never recommend."
1,I read this book and was very disappointed. It is not a book foranyone who has studied history.It is as simplistic and bias as a jr high history class.My advice---give it a miss. I sold my copy on Ebay.
2,"I was looking for a quick reader for a book report and came upon this one. I got it to listen to for an easy way out, but it turned out to be a great book!"
2,"This series has some validity in its presentations, though some theatrical license is taken to make it more ""Hollywoodish"" The basic message of respect for those persons with no body is dealt with in a good manner. Where it departs from reality, there is still merit in watching the work with Spirit."
2,Life Makeovers: 52 Practical & Inspiring Ways to Improve Your Life One Week at a TimeA great book read it an do the exercises and it will change all areas of your life for the better. Cheryl Richardson is a very nice woman she will motivate and inspire you to improve all areas of your life.
1,"The week by week format makes the book easy to read, however I have found many unnecessary and worry-provoking entries which really turned me off from the book. For example, every week has a section ""How Your Actions Affect Your Baby's Development"". In one of the early weeks, this section is entirely about different types of miscarriage, which made me wonder if Dr. Curtis is somehow implying that all misarriages are caused by women's actions? Further on, there are sonogram pictures of a tumor as well as a knot in the umbilical cord, without any note that such conditions are extremely rare. What the point is of including these anxiety-provoking points, I do not know. As well, Dr. Curtis seems to take a rather traditional medical viewpoint to pregnancy. Overall, I found the book to be more bothersome than helpful, both in its lack of explanation of some dangers and its overabundance of worry-provoking entries. I would not recommend this book."
2,"After losing my previous wireless presenter to a classroom thief, I replaced it with this one and it's better than I expected."
1,"I got the dvd soundtrack set and omg I will never let a kid hear the cd ever. with lines from the song right thurr by chingy on the cd!""Jeans saggin' so I can see her thong a l'il bit I know you grown a little bit, twenty years old, you legal"" ok what is that doing on a kids cd?!?!?! oh it gets better he has 2 songs on the cd I like that: ""Put ya hands upShake it fast on meI'm that pimp you needTen G's in tha pocket and I'm ready to rollI'm on fire like a rocket and I'm ready to blow"" in the real song it says nigga not pimp do you want your kid singing that?!"
2,"...ever try to find a replacement blade? You won't find one anywhere but from Fiskar's Customer Service (1.800.500.4849). Fiskar does not make the replacement blades available to their vendors. Bizarre. First replacement blade is free. Additional blades are $7.99 + S&H. Blade order number for the 32"" Lopper is 7100-7369. Customer service at Fiskar is wonderful. I just think it stinks that this is the only way to get a replacement blade."
2,"Note: I bought these when they were a gold box deal for less than $10, but believe me, they are worth the regular price.I really like these earbuds, they block out most noise around you (aside from really loud things, like cars) and the sound quality is excellent. I have recommended these to other people who like to listen to music while they workout, be outside, on a crowded bus...these things will block out all annoying sounds and people. They fit comfortably in your ear and do not shake loose or fall out like those other annoying earbuds (like the kind you get with an iPod).The price is good, they come in a nice assortment of colors, I really cannot recommended these enough!"
1,"I got the impression that the Celestron 50AZ, 60AZ, and 70AZ, all had correctly oriented images. The 50AZ is corrected up-down, but is backwards left-to-right. To get a correctly oriented image you need to move up to the 60AZ or 70AZ.I also noticed that when the center of the image was in focus the outer ring was distorted or out of focus, so I really could only look at about half the image area.I have returned this and got a 70AZ instead, and am quite happy with it."
1,Whilst the book is a good and informative text i was very upset by the state of the book on arrival. The book looked like a second hand book with creases. Packaging needs to be done better.
1,"We drive I-95 from NY to Florida about four times a year. We use mostly our GPS for speed and routes. I also have and use the ""I-95 Exit Information Guide"" (from Maine to Florida)which is a great book and it sits right next to me. This ""Drive I-95"" was very disappointing to me. The information in it is seven years old, (2005) (3rd. addition) It excludes Maine of Florida and it omits most of Massachusetts, Exits 13 to 60 So its not a true I-95 guide. Its designed to read ""UP THE PAGE"" divided into two different sections driving North or South. which is not normal and is confusing. The center part is the only good part. It reads like a history lesson that makes good reading. (2 stars) I will take it with me for bedtime reading. Too bad the edition outdated."
2,"It felt a little like being back in the youthful days of working on merit badges. Here was a new and very phat book of bite sized devotionals and I started out really excited and determined to actually follow through for a whole year. I'm about a month into the process and I couldn't be happier with these empowering nuggets of sensible topics to ponder and reflect about. There is already a growing confidence in me because the book doesn't give answers as much as invite my own reflections and perspectives. It feels like each week is earning me private, interior merit badges that I bless myself with. I recommend this book and its process to anyone."
1,"This book has some good points, and it would have made a great article in something like ""Reader's Digest."" But a full-length book? Not so much. All of the ideas presented are s t r e t c h e d into too many pages. Then they become diluted, simple, and annoying.But the cover is cool."
1,"Endless.... This book takes us inside a hospital, but its no fun. Long and boring, wait until there are ER books."
1,I only had this mat for one week when the center became brittle and cracked. It stuck to the bottom of my oven. It was useless...
2,"My family loved this movie! It has quirky, but lovable characters. It is hilariously funny. Who wouldn't love a minion? Great family entertainment!"
1,"This book is limited in scope and in some of its advice it is misinformed. If you want to be a good patient it may be a good book for you. Otherwise, don't bother buying it or toss it out a window if you have it. I was glad I did not waste my money since it was given to me. My advice, try the Sears' books, Sheila Kritzinger's books, or others along those lines."
2,"My husband has been looking for this watch to replace his old,broken one. It is exactly the same as the one he had worn for years... nice to find it still out there and at a reasonable price. Amazon strikes again! Thanks'"
2,"This album, originally released in 1988, features both great songs and excellent instrumentals written by fiddler Ric Sanders. The highlight is the title track, written by Ralph McTell and telling the tale of a savage battle during the English Civil War that occurred at Cropredy Bridge between King Charles' Royalists and Oliver Cromwell's Puritans. A brilliant song beautifully performed by the band, and Simon Nicol's singing has never been better. Plus Dave Pegg's bass sounds great, too (I ought to know. I own it!) But in all seriousness, this is a fine CD well worth the attention of Fairport and British folk fans."
1,"Being a big Eastwood fan, I bought this unseen and watched it for the first time last night. Eastwood is great, as always, although his cop character in this one displays a little more vulnerability than most of his tough guy roles. Locke's acting is over-the-top and annoying, as always. This is a pretty good action movie, but the ending is ridiculous. After blasting the hell out of this bus, the cops are just going to let Eastwood walk up the steps of city hall with a gun tucked into his waistband? I mean, no one says a word to him. And on top of that, he takes the assistant d.a. hostage and Locke's character shoots the police commissioner dead in front of the entire Phoenix police department, and nobody does a damn thing? Are you kidding? I'm all for suspending a sense of reality when watching action movies, but give me a break. This ain't no academy-award winner. Eastwood is the only thing saving this turkey."
2,"This is the 3rd book I have read so far which is by Ms. Stokes.It is about a girl with questions about her birthright. It is about a woman who was in a flight for freedom and independence and about one's family's demons that separated and broke a family. It is about feminism and the problems that lie within. It is about despair, hopelessness and living in fear but it is also about family reconciliation and hope and joy.Still, I am recommending this book because it will touch your heart. Another one of the books which no reader should miss."
2,"This is a must have item if you use your ladder alot. It has enough width when needed and easily switches to greater stand-off. Will get you safely on and off a roof from the gable side if needed. It will also easily get you on and off the peak as well. Plenty of stand-off for deep eaves and plenty of width for stability or servicing double windows. I am surprised at how light weight it is, doesn't make extending the ladder any more difficult at all. Nice that the sides come off to move the ladder around easier. Has nice large soft pads that are big enough to spread the load and not mar any surface. Expensive as stand offs go but well worth the extra. Buy with confidence."
1,"I thought this book was very poorly written and leaves much to be desired. There are few details that I found enlightening and enjoyable. I would not recommend this book to anyone seeking a true glimpse of this region. For the true adventurers, do not buy this book, save your money. For those wanting to learn more about the region, I am sure there are better books out there that will better prepare you for a visit."
2,"I think the adidas products are one the best of the entire world, and this is not the exception..."
2,"an undiscovered continent peopled by not-quite people. I felt as if I were an ""anthropologist from Mars"" (c.f. Oliver Sacks) inspecting the social habits of, say, ants--they look like humans, they talk like humans but the behave soooooo. . ."
2,"I really enjoyed reading this but could have done without Triona's constant fits. She was so angry and this is understandable but I could not sympathize with her as I can with other characters. I also got tired of Aud calling her ""Sweeting"".I did really love Ronan and his struggles. He put up with Triona a lot longer than I wanted him to."
2,"This book went far beyond my expectations! The detail and attention these women gave to every aspect of creating a meal is incredible. This is not just a recipe book, but an education on everything in your kitchen, from measurements and ingredients to the best equipment for the job. An absolute joy just to read before you even begin to create."
1,"The gloves arrived and had a strong smell of mildew.I washed them, but that didn't work. Nothing will take out that smell.Consequently, I am not using them and threw them away. Waste of money"
2,"With his first novel, Mark Fabi has launched himself onto the forefront of a new age of writers by showing the one capacity necessary to all great writers: an intrinsic knowledge of which story will grab a readers attention. In Wyrm, I found myself frustrated by the sometimes confusing and wordy narration, yet willing to push through the weak spots to find out what the next plot twist brought. It is in his research and in his simple explanation of a complex plot that Fabi really shines. A must-read for anyone who enjoys a mix of fantasy and fiction."
1,"I think they stopped selling this product in stores near me, so since I had used it regularly before I went to buy it online. The product was drier than it should have been, so it flaked off and irritated my eyes. Defintely not the product it used to be, so I'll have to find another favorite."
2,"i think to most people of the world..douglas clark is a normal looking man...no handsome gigalo or anything like that...so he must have had the gift of a silver tongue,he seemed to be able to charm the birds from the tree`s and woman to become obsessed with him,physically and mentally. within this book it talks of clark living with or just staying with a numerous amount of women,some he converted to just live with him,some to be sex objects for him and one to..help him fulfill his ultimate fantasy...murder.the author holds no punches as clark picks up and has his way with young girls,who had turned to prostitution...at times gruesome and shocking but rivetting stuff...if you like serial killing books.get this.."
2,"If you're looking for an attractive outdoor clock that will heartily withstand the elements, this is a great buy. I bought mine last summer to use by the pool - the large face and numbers are easily read from a distance, although you need to be fairly close to check the temp/humidity readings. It's been hanging unsheltered on a fence for over 12 months now, through baking hot temperatures in the summer, ferocious rainstorms year-round, and below-freezing weather in the winter, and it hasn't lost a single second. It's also still using the SAME BATTERIES it was a year ago. Not sure why other reviewers felt this wasn't a good outdoor clock, because mine has been going strong since day 1. Definitely recommend!"
2,"Not only is the music great, but the videos are great also. Inventive with excellent production."
2,I have had Ansel Adam calendars for sometime now. They are always interesting and high quality. The prints used never let me down.
2,"I bought the navigator for 2-main reasons, 1- to hold the iPod in the care as a dock, 2- for charging the iPod during listening to music in the car.But hearing the iPod through the FM transmitter was not my gib aim, as im using the cassette instead, because the music recieved from the FM is less quality from the cassette and we know why for radio waves and less sterio, other might enjoy it.So bottom line the navigator works fine with the ability to use the cassette so no inouts are blocked from the navigator with the cigarette adjustable plug makes the navigator placed at prefered angle in the car from the gear.Thanks;)"
2,Great for what we wanted. Very well made. Fits right over our pool table. Paddles are really well made also.
1,I do not think the charger is designed well...I think it is a horrible concept that the Sony Erickson made their charger male and female plug to be so difficult!
1,"Having read 1901 I was expecting more of this book. Basically his premise is England joins the war on the Confederate side and suddenly the Union makes all the right moves. Little to no research, shoddy writing and told from only one point of view. Throw in the authors version of a romance novel in the middle and you've got 1862. Good starting point for an alternate history but downhill from there."
2,"Excellent, smooth music, great jazz insight, excellent: Style,mix,encouraging,relaxing,uplifting, I recommend it to all smooth jazz lovers. You will enjoy your new CD."
1,"A Gathering of Old Men is a good book to read if you like reading an entire book on one single day. I found the book pretty boring. I feel you only need about three chapters to write about one day. The book was long and drawn out. The only thing that made it somewhat interesting was the descriptions of the people and using different narrators. It does a great job of giving reference to southern racism and problems with land, money, and people. The way the book is written you can't tell if the author is black or white, male or female in that sense it's a real good book but you have to have a lot of time and patience. You would also have to be a young adult or an adult to understand most of the meaning, words etc... It has a lot of profanity and other inappropriate stuff in it for young children. The content of the book is mostly rated PG 13 but it slips up to R every once and awhile. Other than that it was an ok book that I would only recommend to older people."
1,"I felt a little stinging at each use and at first it seemed like my bumps would go down, but by the next morning, my zits become bigger."
2,"I loved this story when i was a child, and i am really looking forward to sharing it with the children in my life"
1,"I can't even believe this crap is in stores. My homegirl rented it and it put me to sleep, and when I woke up, I didn't feel lost on the ""plot"" because the whole thing was just plain dumb. I was so mad she made me sit and watch the whole movie like it was gonna get any better. I expected more out of Katt because I love his stand-up but this and It's Pimpin Pimpin are HUGE disappointments."
1,"As a baby-sitters club fan, I was completley and totally upset about finding out about the real Dawn. Dawn was my favorite charecter. Now I don't even buy the books anymore."
1,"I've had other ergonomic keyboards before from Adesso and really enjoyed them. This keyboard however is flat, which is not at all what I wanted. The function key support is alright, but sometimes malfunctions. As has been noted previously, the 6 key is on the wrong side of the keyboard. The software interface for the keyboard is patchy at best and does not always work well. The USB ports on the keyboard work okay as long as you're not plugging in external storage devices; for some reason, the devices have a nasty habit of disappearing from the desktop. About all that can be said is buyer beware, this may not be exactly what you think."
2,"I have two adopted Korean children and bought this book the minute I heard it won the Newberry. I read it in one sitting and absolutely loved it--wonderful characters, beautifully written, genuine emotion. It is so much better than some of the absolute dreck (see my review of ""The Triumph of Katie Byrne,"" for example), that passes for adult fiction these days. My husband read it to my daughter's fourth grade class and the kids loved it as well. I warned my husband that he would cry at the end (I did). This is such a terrific book that I bought all of the author's books and am looking forward to reading them as well."
1,"After a few months of use this didn't trim very well. Everything seems to work, but it doesn't trim.On inspection, the blade unit isn't rising up to the top, it stays low in meta guard. Cleaning with alcohol didn't help.I think the blade unit is supposed to rise up as it spins, lifting off the base rotor. This allows it to trim, while reducing the risk of cutting tissue. My guess is that with time it may fail to lift off.I don't like replacing things every few months. It's wasteful, not to mention annoying."
1,"I bought this game for my roomate i dont know why he likes it ,it gives me a headache ,you have to you have to line up the buttons on the game in order to keep playing the music if you miss a button you screwed up and have to start all over again , and the music is loud and annoying some of the songs are nice but that's about it after a while it gets to ya ,in my opinion it's a pointless waste of money."
1,"This is the kind of film that Europeans love about America: it has every single ridiculous stereotype about suburban life, from hiding your true feelings from the neighbors to gun-totting nut cases who beat their children.It was so bad that I was stunned at the attention it got. Not a single scene or emotion rings true. Is this, along with film versions of cartoons and old TV shows, the best that Hollywood can do?"
2,"Like most people I grew up with The Muppets and this is just how I remember it. Four generations of people in my family went nuts when I put this on, everybody had a smile their face. We had a lot of fun singing along with it."
1,"If you are looking for a horror movie, rent ""Final Destination"", if you are looking for psychosis, rent ""In Dreams"", if you are looking for imaginary rabbits, rent ""Harvey"". There is nothing new here. There are way too many plot elements that are never explored. The basic plot is so flawed that even die hard sci-fi fans won't get behind it."
2,WONDERFUL! EVERY FRAME OF IT. HAVE SEEN IT TWICE ALREADY. IF THERE IS A BETTER FILM THIS YEAR...I HAVEN'T SEEN IT!
2,"first book i read from this author and definitely not the last one. I thought the book was cute and funny, romantic with fun and drama. what more do i need."
2,"This tool is a must for working on CIS fuel injection systems. It is easy to use. However, it could use longer hoses so that you can be in the car and watch the gauge as you crank and start the enguine. Otherwise, works great and not a bad price."
2,"My son, the origami nut, loves this tiny paper for his origami projects. You have to be really skilled at origiami to work with such small paper. It comes in many beautiful colors and it should last a long time with that many sheets! It was easy to buy this paper because it's hard to find such a small size locally."
2,"I love this CD, it is powerful praise and worship. Being a worship leader it is one project that truly brings you into the power and presence of the Lord. Expecially, ""When I Think About The Lord"". It truly does, ""Make Me Wanna Shout!!! Hallelujah!!!!"
1,"When I purchased Magical game cards I thought the set would be more highly priced. I looked at the box and I was right. It said it was a $...value for $... I reasearched why this was. This game appeared to be two years old and is not a fad anymore. My question was answered. So I purchased the game. The box came equipped with five booster packs, three of which were for other expansion packs of Harry Potter. One Starter set, and four seven packs of movie cards which cannot be played with. When I played it it was so boring. The object of the game is to make your opponent discard all of his or her cards. Other reviews you may read about this item say you can cast fun spells and summon creatures to duel in battle, but when you really start to get into playing you'll see its just a matter of discarding cards. One after another. I'd recommend this game for ages 6 to 9."
1,If you send Deltron your faulty Battery Tender Junior along with about half of what you paid for it they will call and tell you how much it will cost you to have them fix it. I didn't believe it either. I went to their website for more information as the Warranty suggested and could find nothing. I will fix it myself; with a hammer.
1,I bought as a gift for my husband and they are still brand new and after 1 or 2 uses have that rust color stain on them and are just light and cheap and bend in the hot oven... cheap and cheap!!
2,"This book takes you from group homes to the mean streets of Harlem where Claude Brown tested fate and even some of societies taboos yet was able to pull himself up from the ghetto. He looks at child hood frineds that slipped through the cracks of society that became heroin addicts, pimps, players, pushers, and prostitutes. He shows exactly what life in the ghettos is all about the pain and the suffering. I've read this book three times and it gets better each time."
2,"If you're a brittney murphey fan you'll probably love this movie. However, there are a lot of subtitles, so if you don't like to read them you'll probably get lost quickly."
2,I use it with my Nikon D5100. The focus and level of detail in the image is very good.I recommend it for those who wish to work with macro photography.
1,"My ""Nissan 15.9-Ounce Travel Mug/Food Storage Jar"" Kitchen; ...eachLEAKS out around the seal between the drinking lid and the mug. The problem occurs when the coffee cools and condensation forms inside. The problem is getting worse and I've had coffee leak all over me many times. I've tried drying the seal and screwing it tighter and nothing works. I suppose this mug may be defective and will seek a replacement or refund."
2,I used this book during my first year of law school and it provided me with great legal writing skills. My summer employers found my writing easy to understand and well-formatted. I still defer my legal writing questions to the book in my upper-level law courses.
1,"I tried to get through this novel twice. My Uncle gave it to me after buying it in Ireland. I couldn't even get past the ""War And Peace"" style writing and eventually had to give up. I never did find out about my family."
1,"Just got a 6 pack of Better'n Peanut Butter 16 Oz original. My elderly mother pointed out it was full of sugars and syrups- i had not tried it yet. I found it is horribly sweet and sugary, tastes like a honey/syrup-peanut butter and nothing like peanut butter at all. regret that i now have 6 jars, would never buy it again"
2,This hair cutting kit is a much higher quality kit than the low price would indicate. My wife cut my hair for the first time with it and did a better job than many barbers. Very happy with this product.
2,"Although these are called wine stoppers, a better name would be vacuum seals. We have enjoyed dining with wine daily for years, but we were discouraged there wasn't a way to preserve leftover wine. The vacuum pump and ""seals"" are a great way to truly preserve leftover wine for a few days without disappointment! The seals (and pump) last for a few years."
2,"I'm glad I'm one of the few who saw this movie when it was released. Incredible cast and performances. If you're a Paul Newman fan and haven't seen this movie, just go ahead and buy it now. Because it was a ""small"" picture, it is very difficult to find!"

1,"The toy I ordered was not the toy I received. I ordered mine from ""Little Languages"" on Amazon - what I received was a small, cheap piece of junk. My son only played with it a little bit and it frustrated him because once on the elevator the cars don't really have any place to go and the ramps are very flimsy and composed of multiple, unstable pieces. Total ripoff by Little Languages - what you see on the website is not what you get in the mail."

This Metallica c.d. did sell out and i hate very thing about metallica. Any fan of Metallica should go get some real music like Nirvana or Classic stuff like The Beatles or C.C.R.
2,"Hilarious, obnoxiously entertaining, loves! Epic movie for anyone to watch and enjoy! Highly reccommend, no doubt you will be laughing out loud, Enjoy!"
1,"I am not going to beat around the bush. This CD flat out [is bad]. As much as I love Doug and King's X (the only reason I bought this) this release is monsterously boring. Almost every song is the same: chunk chunk chunka wanker solo chunka chunka chunka, no feel. Doug's vocals are completely wasted by a terrible mix (his vocals are absolutely buried). The guitar playing is about as boring as it gets, what year is this anyway? If Bruce Franklin wants to parody Spinal Tap, he's doing a good job.I bought this CD to support Doug and what he does besides King's X, it has hit my CD player maybe twice since then. It's a great CD as a coaster for your drinks..."
1,Boss audio is a good brand but this particular product is not worth wasting money on?Over heats the amplifier.
2,When I take them my legs feel less heavy in the evening...But I have to say I only yook them some 2 weks or so
2,"The book is wonderful, but Amazon, you've got your information wrong. Joseph Campbell didn't design this. He wrote the Introduction. Why do I know this? I designed the book and won an award for it."
1,"I purchased this to use with a Samsung LN-S4692D television (46"" LCD, two HDMI inputs), since I had 3 boxes I wanted to hookup to the TV using HDMI (cable box, DVD player, TiVo HD).Unfortunately, it just wouldn't work properly with my TV. I could get the TV to see the Terk if the TV was already set to the appropriate HDMI input when I turned it on, but as soon as I started cycling through the TV inputs the Terk would disappear (my TV doesn't ""cycle"" through an input if it doesn't detect that a cable is attached to it).I tried all sorts of techniques to see if I couldn't get this to work, but nothing did. Terk's customer service was absolutely useless. It took three emails to get a response, and then that was a ""canned"" response.I'm afraid I can't recommend this product."
2,"After many years of study on conflict and peace-making , I was amazed by the usefulness and wonderful information packed into this small book in a readable, easy-to-understand style. This book has lead to more positive life changes than any other book I have encountered. Both my husband and I read it in one afternoon and have used what we learned everyday since and have shared it with many others. A must-read for any person who would like more understanding of interactions with other people and better relationships in all areas of life."
1,Avoid this game at all costs. I was one of the first to buy this game because of how much I loved GH 2. Too bad this game made me want to avoid all future GH series. This game has 2 maybe 3 songs that are actually fun to play. All of the songs are boring 90% of them I had no idea what they were or why they were chosen for the game. I got 5 gold stars on almost every song my first time around so I knew this 80's game was worthless so I sold it on ebay the next day. It was not fun to play YOU CAN'T BUY MORE SONGS and it's all the same characters just in stupid outfits. Save your money.
2,"Leonie Sandercock has produced a magnificently readable and cool 'sequel' to her 1990s offering of Cosmopolis. Cosmopolis II is a breath of fresh air in the increasingly stale debate over urban planning processes and their links to theory. This could take planners beyond the 'facilitating/mediating' role in battles over planned developments and their impacts, particularly on marginalised peoples and groups. Planners need to become listeners rather than stage-managers, to learn the community's stories and aspirations BEFORE, not after, firm plans or alternatives are devised. A more inclusive approach, which affords communities the chance to tell their own stories and to identify the special values and places in their environments that they want respected, is called for. Sandercock gives current examples of such approaches restoring the development balance in favour of people. They are drawn from progressive 'mongrel cities' : this is not a mere post-modern pipe-dream."
2,"I'm temporarily crippled up so badly I have to use a walker to get around. I put these flames on the front. If I can't move like I used to, I can at least look the part!"
1,"I, too, am a huge Colony, Outer Banks, Up Island fan. But this book was quick, shallow and fluff. Dont buy it in hardback wait for the paperback version or better yet a library rental. I felt that the story should have begun on the last page. The ending was too quick and contrived. To me, the better story would have begun there and moved on. I agree Siddons cranked this one out too quickly."
1,"Just in a word - primitive! A completely predictable story, with really mediocre acting.Amazon really needs to get some great Spanish movies - from Almodovar, etc."
1,"I had purchased a hot air brush that was similar in a department store several years ago. I used it until it finally wore out. When I saw this one, I was ecstatic. However, the product is somewhat inferior. The air blower shuts off if you use it for too long, and the bristles snarl my hair. I don't think I would buy this product again."
2,"I purchased this product to use on the end of my Graco Travel Lite. It works great for holding a few diapers, ointments, etc. However, there is no storage area large enough for wipes. Best item I could find for this use."
2,"these fit perfectly, but were much lighter weight than I had anticipated. However, overall that makes them great for all-year round!"
1,"Bought this headset that was 'suggested"" with Nuance Dragon speech recognition. 2 days later and it's in the trash already. One earpiece came apart when putting it down, and tiny wires detached. Poor construction, not that comfortable. And, the headset that comes free with Dragon seems to have slightly better recognition (can't be sure) and is more comfortable! Don't waste your money on this!!"
1,The best part about this DVD is the cover art. After reading some reviews where people talked the movie up it's B grade at its best. Looks like it was shot using a handy cam and very B grade acting. No new takes on anything.Basically involves a few interwoven stories of groups of people hiding and trying to survive with a zombie epidemic.A couple of scenes worth watching for the slice and dice but a big let down story wise. Personally I'd rent it - you wouldn't watch it more than once.
2,"This is a high-end Velbon tripod, but if you have a few extra dollars and take photography seriously, it might pay to get this one.The height is great and overall body construction is EXTREMELY solid. Not rickety at all. The pan head pans smoothly and the legs lock easily and firmly. Invest wisely in this Velbon. :)"
1,"I was very disappointed in this video. It touched on the basics,but fell short on the in-depth material. The video didn't touch on geocaching or other in-depth features. The garmin free videos are more informative. I would not recommend this to a friend."
1,"Arrived broken, gets stuck in tight spaces, not good for rugs with tassles, blows dirt around on hard floor, and dropped some of its debris when it hit a bump. Oh, and if you want customer service from the manufacturer, prepare to wait on hold for a long, long time."
2,"I heard this author speak a few years ago and fell in love with her simple, straightforward approach to eating and living a healthy life! This is truly the only 'health' book a person needs if they are seeking to improve their lifestyle and their overall way of taking care of themselves. The advice is practical, easy to remember, and easy to incorporate into a daily routine. And - it delivers strong results, from weight loss to lowering blood pressure to simply preserving a healthy lifestyle well in our years. I highly recommend this book to anyone serious about their overall well-being. We only have one body....what's holding us back from preserving its sanctity?"
2,"I love this little knife. Its been missing for a week now, along with the $50 it was clipped to and I really miss it. I started using it clipped to the inside of my pocket and ended up using it as a money clip. It replaced all my other larger folding knifes. I am going to order another one, hopefully it will show up soon. This knife opens everything super smoothly and the special point on it really helps."
2,"I have owned and used this little oven for over 18 months and it is easily the best toaster i have ever owned. We don't baby it at all, has been to college and camping, and still produces perfect toast and bakes evenly at all temps. All knobs, trays, etc... are still intact and working. Worth it at twice the price!"
2,"This phone is good, comparing to Motorola V180 that Cingular is giving for free. Motorola V180 sucks!!!!. This phone has a easy access menu and very easy to Program.Sound is very clear, It's not very fancy, but it does what it suppose to do."
2,Amazing book! Definitely opened my eyes to the truth about abortion. Francine Rivers is a wonderful Christian writer and am in love with her novels.
1,"Just as other customers already said, very simple: After short time the little scroll ball gets erratic and stops scrolling.Why? Obviously because dust gets inside and then makes it malfunction. Unlike all NONApple mouses, here YOU CANNOT remove it and clean it or wash it with soap. Therefore, once it starts working erratically, you can simply throw away you Mighty Cra.. Mouse. Thanks Apple."
2,"These speakers have been discounted to almost free. For the price you get a small package that folds out into a speaker set with a tray to place your mp3 player. You can power the speakers from a USB port, batteries, or power supply (power supply not included). The sound quality is pretty good for tiny speakers. The USB cable and 3.5mm plug are both on the short side, meaning that you'll need them close to the computer or mp3 player. I bought 2 sets. One for using with my mp3 player and another to use with computers. I am very happy with my purchase."
1,"If you feel that all you need is aboout 1/4 mile or less notice of radar traps, and you just cant deal with a corded model, then this is for you Granny. If you have a heavy foot and must own an Escort, get the 8500 corded unit. Myself, I'm moving to Valentine as I have no confidence in Escort's pititul technology anymore. 1 Bail Bond"
1,"To start with, after about the third label it started printing any vertical line very faintly and with lines in it. The straight part of the L,P,H,etc. is barely visible.So of course a labeler that doesn't print well is worth nothing.Add on top of that the fact that the labels are so hard to peel that they require the patience and nerves of a neurosurgeon. I ended up getting out the tweezers. Because it's so hard to peel, the labels end up mangled and look horrible once you stick them.One more thing, even with the power adapter in, after you print a label a warning comes on saying low power. It does this with batteries too, so if you're using batteries (not a good idea) how do you know if it's really low on power?I've had this two days and it's being returned."
1,"This is a wonderful product, out of the box. The UI and included software are very intuitive. The accessories are great. The docking station even has a cool blue light on it. But take a look around the forums - hard drive failures are everywhere. Mine stopped working about 14 months after purchase, had not been abused and had been used only indoors and in the car. Now I have a three-bill pile of junk. Buy this product only if you have limitless patience for wasting money, and easy access to surplus laptop hard drives."
1,"Would the powers that be for heavens sake reissue the Stewart Granger version of ""King Solomons Mines"". He is Alan Quartermain personified and Deborah Kerr is a more than credible female lead. All else is dross. And while we are at it could we also have the same star casting in the fantastic ""Prisoner Of Zenda"". Stewart Granger like many of his contemporaries is under-represented in the DVD revolution."
2,"Once again, RUSH proves they are the greatest band of all time.Heart Full of Soul should be the biggest hit of 2004. Radio, as usual, will probably be too stupid to play it, though. What a shame!"
1,"This would be a great game if it was playable, but it's bad and getting worse. I really honestly liked the design, but it's rare to go more than a few minutes without a bug somehow interfering with play. After a patch introduced a new game breaking ""factory"" bug I just kept playing hoping they'd fix it. They didn't. In fact, it took them three tries just to get a patch that would create a workaround for the bug.Very sad. There's an interesting game here. But it's buried beneath bugs."
1,This book was a nice fast read. Not sure if I would recommend to my friends or not but it was interesting.
1,"I picked up this jigsaw because of the relatively low price and because my father has a B&D jigsaw that has never given him any problems. I also liked the quick clamp blade system.For light work around my house the saw does an adequate job. However, as soon as I cut anything tougher than 3/4 inch particle board I notice the blade wandering. At first, I thought I was feeding the saw too fast but even when creeping through the material (pine 1x6 as well as a 1 3/8 inch solid core door) the blade still wanders.Additionally, the dust blower/extractor doesn't work very well.Finally, this little saw really gives you a workout from all of the vibration that it produces.If you only need a light duty jigsaw and don't want to spend a bunch of money, this saw will work for you. If you will be cutting tougher stock, I would recommend spending the extra money and going with a higher end saw (personally, I have my eye on the new Bosch jigsaw, as 6.4 amps should cut through anything)."
2,"I went to see this movie in theaters because I wanted to be able to say I saw a silent film in a theater. But it is so much more than that. The Artist is a love song to the glory days of Hollywood, a time we have never been able to recapture and never will. It is also a history lesson wrapped up in a lot of fun. The only other movie I know of that depicts the troubling and, for some, ruinous time of the birth of talkies in Singing in the Rain. However, the Artist takes it one step further and tells the story in the way it would have been told at the time. The aspect ratio, the cuts, the music, the directing, the scenes, and the silent aspect of the acting all come straight of the period and all are wondrously compiled into a compelling movie even for today's audiences. I predict that this film will be one that film students will be discussing for decades to come."
1,"I felt like the first hundred or so pages of the book promised a lot of truly vicarious devastation, but then I got to the end and Powers' had delivered nothing. This book is dullsville; read it and feel absolutely nothing during the story's climax. In all fairness, Powers writes very well, it's just that the content of this book bores me. Maybe my problem is that I was expecting it to be much more sci-fi and dramatic, and to me it read more like a semi-masturbatory litany of the sufferings of the author at the hands of his bipolar ex-girlfriend."
2,"This is a great book and about the only one I know that is dedicated to the subject. Whether you carve birds, figurines, animals, fish or just whittle or build things to sell in your shop - this book gives a great inside view on what it's like to then sell your items. I give it 4 stars as it's now outdated with all the advancements with marketing via the internet. We need more books or instruction for beginners and those old hands looking to sell their work for the first time - it's a lot to learn and the more of us doing so successfully will only increase the attention to the artform and make all of us better for it. Looking forward to more on the subject!"
2,"""The Word According to Garp"" is the most woundrouslywritten book I've ever read! The characters were sofascinating and exciting to me I would think about themall day, and still do. John Irving has really constructedthis book perfectlynever a dull moment.- Dolly Housholder (age 17)"
2,"The movies were all good, I have yet to watch the bonus features, but the quality was good. I highly recommend this product for anyone interested in the series if you have not seen them before."
2,"The Wheel of Time is one of the best known Fantasy series to date. It is very good... most of it. This book is one of the best it has to offer. As you move through the series, however the series slowly begins to lose its edge. Around book 5 you notice a drop in the overall quality of the books... but thankfully it doesn't drop much lower after that (think Goodkind) and just stays at that level. If you choose to read this book, you will probably love it, finish all the series' books released to date, and eventually finish the series, even if some of the succeeding books aren't nearly as good. This book IS great, but be warned that if you start you will almost certainly HAVE to ""finish"" (if Jordan and you happen to live that long)."
2,"Injured during a stampede at a rock concert more than a decade before, Grace Lawson is unaware when she finds a misplaced photo in her order from a photo shop that this will lead her on a trail full of mystery and intrigue, back to that one day in time.Harlan Coben has written another great mystery, full of twists and turns, one that will leave you guessing until the very end. This was one book I was anxious to return to and didn't want to leave while reading. I really enjoy this author's style."
1,"This is actually Mark Lindsay re-recording his own solo hits and Paul Revere and the Raiders hits. Sounds terrible, not much like the originals. I threw away the CD. Anyway, looking for these songs should stick with the originals."
2,Excellent Source of mafia information. This item is exactly what the title says: A mafia encylopedia. A great read for all Mafioso fans. Nice and thick with lots of photos.
2,"To me,this really answered alot of questions.If your a BG fan,get this and you wont be disapointed.Lots of great extras aswell."
1,"I'm going to be honest here, I NEVER liked in flames, ever... but i allways respected them for creating inovative, qualitatively good music. Behind Space (99 whatever) is even one of the songs that i learned how to plan on my guitar. just out of respect though, cause their music just isnt really 'my thing', but i listen to their stuff sometimes anyway (not too long, gives me a headache)But now for this album... what the hell are these guys thinking?? this is NU-metal! now i have even lost my respect for this band! the guitars are plain stupid, the vocals are just waaay too Korny, and the entire innovative aspect of their band just dissappeard unto thin air.My GOODNESS in flames, how low can you go?0/1000"
1,"I wasn't waiting for a super blockbuster media hit with this one, but the overall experience was Ok. And it was more than enough for a title that no one speak about."
1,"Upon downloading it to my computer, I could only got to Step I, and could not play the game at all. This is the reason for the low scores on my review of the game. How would I go about returning this product?"
1,This product contains no subtitles or alternative audio. It is Chinese language only and pretty much worthless for someone who does not speak the language.

2,Great product. This coffee pot is the best i have ever owned. It brews hotter then any of the other coffee makers I have owned. You a have full pot of coffee in 3 minutes. Fantastic !!!
2,"I just got this CD and it is one of the best that I have bought in a long time. It is not your regular run-of-the-mill CD with the same old tunes. This is different, unique and that uniqueness makes it so refreshing. It definitely sounds a bit folksy but it is also very relaxing and upbeat. I love it. Get it now. I don't think you will be disappointed."
1,I would like to review it. When are you going to send it to me?
1,"The variety pack has three varieties that are all only 10 or 11 grams of protein each, with a whopping 24 grams of sugar. The blend is a basic recipe that they then flavor with various ingredients, like peanut butter or chocolate chips. The mixture is tasty and is a chewy crunchy blend of organic ingredients. But alas the protein count is way too low, and the sugar way too high."
1,"If you want to learn asp.net, this book is not the one. All it does is talk."
1,Foudn the text minimally helpful. Not full of insight but just common sense.Cost is too high for the return.
1,"You know what, I tried but I cant continue reading this book. Its boring and I cant get into it. Read it if you want, hope you get something out of it. Good Luck"
2,"A very approachable and informative book by a very knowledgeable and kind lady, Gail Faith Edwards of Blessed Maine Herb Farm. I remember when she started the company decades ago and am amazed and delighted at how it has grown. I knew I would love this book, because I love Gail and I love herbs, but my high expectations were actually exceeded! I recommend this so highly. I know it may seem that I am biased, given that I do know Gail, but notice that everybody else reviewing this book says the same thing: IT'S WONDERFUL!"
1,"It was my mistake, but, I wanted THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT, not THE KIDS ARE ALRIGHT. I bought the wrong movie. I have not even viewed this one. UGH!!!!!"
1,"Christianity--by virtue of its divine founder--cannot change. If it changes, it isn't Christianity any longer. There are certain doctrines which are an integral part of Christianity, and to deny those is to deny the very basis for our faith. Unfortunately, Mr. Spong (who doesn't even deserve to be a bishop) seems to have conveniently forgotten this in order to continue in his own sin."
2,"We would recomend this movie to all this movie hits home and things like this are still going on today around the world. It takes you in to some ones life and tell you the extremes you have to go threw just to have some kind of equality,been there done it in my life,now married legaly to my partner. This movie also shows that the church and state should be seperated,because of the diffrent beleifs between the both,it's like oil and water doesnot mix. We give this movie two thumbs up,watch it you will enjoy it,afterall maybe it could help you to move on. The times you think you may have friends and you think you can count on them when times are tough that is when you find out your true friend so donnot be fooled and again enjoy this movie we did.Prom Queen"
2,"This is the first time I've ever rated anything but... this product is amazing. I use it to hold a Sony HD camcorder above my Nikon D5100 DSLR and it works great. This is a very useful tool and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking to use it for a similar application. I would imagine that it would also work well with an audio recording device, a stationary light that has this type of mount or even a smaller digital camera or camcorder. I am so happy to have discovered this item."
1,"I am a long-time Kava fan and rate all her other books five-stars, no doubt. But this book I struggled with. It did not hold my attention from the very beginning. There wasn't enough there to make me want to read more. I finally stopped around 100 pages just because I found myself not caring about what happened with the character, plot, etc. I gave up, the first time I've done that with an Alex Kava book, and I feel guilty about it but I just couldn't continue. All of her other books are excellent and I was disappointed that I couldn't get into this one."
1,"The only reason I gave this movie one star is because there isn't a lower rating. THis is a terrible movie, and a somewhat scary portrait of modern thinking. This movie can be summed up simply,""Sex equalls love"". This is one of the shallowest and most superficial films I have ever had the misfortune to spend money on. Don't watch, and for Pete's sake, don't let your children watch it. It'll suck the intelligence right out of them."
2,"It reminded me of movies from old. Had a flavor to it as if John Carpenter had directed it, but nicer. Well done Craig Moss (Director)."
1,"I am just reading the Hornblower series for the first time and reading them in the publishers order. Hornblower During The Crisis is an unfinished book, seriously unfinished, the main story only runs 129 pages and would have been wonderful if he had finished the novel (the author passed away). Bundled with 2 other very short stories this book really isn't worth the price."
2,"Don't let the title of our review fool you, we both thought it was an excelent book. It was a fast book to read, but it has a deep theme to it. If you are not a big reader, check this book out.It was a great teen novel, you could really picture what was happening. When you read, you will find Steve Harmon to be a heart winning character--Andrew Meyer and Grant Carden, New York Times"
1,"...""Is that all there is?"" Very disappointing; I am amazed at all the worship this book has inspired. Overly saccharine story and unsatsifying ending. I did like the scenes where the main character is reunited with his deceased wife, but that's not enough to recommend the book."
2,"If you've ever used a TI-82, a TI-83, a TI-86, a TI-92, or a TI-89 :-), you'll be very fermiliar with the TI-89. Most commands are interchangable with the other TI graphing calculators. Since most classes use TI-82s or TI-83s, you can easily adapt the instructions of the teacher for use on the TI-89.The calculator is actually powered by the same processor as the Macintosh Plus/SE, so it is very fast when graphing, solving equasions, or playing games. The screen is sharp enough to hold several expressions and answers or display a smooth view of a curve.Functions include the excellent CAS (try ""solve(0=1x^2+2x+3,x)""), basic scientific math functions, programs (games), matricies (like a primitive spreadsheet), graphing, statistics, and many other functions."
1,"I wanted to get real clay chips but most sellers do not ship to APO address or shipping cost was very expensive. So, I decided to get this from Amazon w/ free shipping. Overall rating was great so I thought it would be the right choice. I don't really understand how this item was rated as 4 stars. Poor quality chips and decks, dusty. It is very light and made of chip plastic. Some people might say ""what do you expect for $36?"" but I just want to let you know this is not the one you need if you are looking for casino quality poker chips."
1,"This item does not create enough suction to even stay on the nipple and the rubber rings fall right off (at least on me they do). Rings are too soft (pliable) to stay on nipple. I have used rubber rings before that stayed on until you wanted to take them off; and that was putting them on by hand without any kind of nipple pump. This nipple ""erector"" is a joke; I've used small plastic bottles that worked better."
2,"Released on April 29, 2003, this is a solid retrospective of the textures and avant-garde work from the 1970s, with solid rhythms that keeps the focus on the technological aspects now found in the studio.The 10 numbers - clocking in at 71:01 - were designed for a Japanese/American co-produced documentary, which apparently has never been released. The music stands alone and demonstrates that Edgar Froese does not have to cruise through releasing ""updated"" albums, remixes and live material from the vast TD archives."

1,"While I enjoyed the premise, improved villians, and character development during the first 3 novels in this series, I found myself unable finish the 4th, as Cadderly has grown from a talented but sorely inexperienced initiate of Deneir to a virtual demigod.The attaction of Cadderly to me was the idea of a heroic character who survived as much on wits, intelligence, and able teamwork as overpowering force. And while this often held true through the initial books in this series, Cadderly is a one man wreaking crew here, his otherwise potent companions often serving as little more than conversation pieces and humour devices. Ancient red dragons, interplanar beings, arch magicians, the outcome of any encounter is never in doubt. Honestly, the only apparent way to defeat Cadderly is to gag him. While others may appreciate a seemingly omnipotent hero, I was gradually left without any feeling of suspense, and ultimately a lack of any interest to continue reading."

2,"I have heard it argued that this book is dry and unreadable. Personally, I think that those who would call it dry mistake a lack of flowery language for clarity of voice.While it clearly has an agenda to prove, this book is very well articulated and supports most of its ideas very well with facts. Nothing is ever proven (a difficult task indeed!), but the information presented is very compelling, and, even if you are not swayed by Diamond's thesis, the wealth of interesting data presented in an interesting and understandable fashion makes it worth the read."
2,"This CD is by far one of the best I have heard in a long while. I haven't even seen the show, but after hearing this soundtract I am making arrangements to go asap.Absolutely fantastic!!"
2,"I worked for a company that followed the Be Our Guest philosophy years ago and enjoyed the focus on perfecting customer service. I felt my current organization is traveling along the same path and could benefit from a book like this. The book does not give you an a-ha moment but rather tools you can apply to your day to day operations. As a Disney fan, it is very interesting to learn how they get the buy in from their cast members and see it spill over to their guests. This is a great book to purchase if you are looking for that little extra something to give back to your customers and keep them coming back."
1,"I've heard this book is now being introduced into history classes, and taught to children in the fourth grade. That's good- they probably couldn't handle the complexity of Erich von Daniken's works until at least fifth grade.When will we have faith-healers teaching health class, hmmm?-Scott"
1,"This product is a toaster. Nothing else.The timer control has 3 settings (for toast only), LIGHT-MEDIUM_DARK.In trying to cook a 6in. frozen pizza, it took 4 turns of the dial (to DARK) to produce an undercooked, soogy crusted pizza.This is a real POS. Dials are hard to read, does not cook ANYTHING well but toast.There are better choices, for less $. Stay away from this one."
1,"This part was not at all like it was described, attempts to return seem to be failing as well. Very dissatisfied!"
1,"Don't buy 2 of these! The 2 we got operate on the same frequency with no option to change the frequency. So when our 2 kids try to play with their cars at the same time, each controller operates both cars and fights ensue! If you want your kids to get mad at each other and drive you nuts, buy 2 of these cars."
2,"Ripping story, horribly dated and hoplessly anti-civil rights and anti-feminist. Mores and situations unsuitable for unsupervised children, but could be used as a starting point for discussion."
2,"I bought the original 4 record set of this music over 35 years ago! It has been a tradition to play the music while decorating the tree. I made cassette copies for my daughter when she moved away on her own----even to England. She has kept up the tradition to this day. We were concerned about the longevity of cassettes, so were SO anxious to see if this 'wunnerful' music was available on CD. Imagine my extreme thrill to find it on your website!! I ordered this and another CD for her and myself. Now we can be assured of listening to his fantastic music for many years to come. What memories flood back!! No one plays Christmas music like Lawrence Welk! THANK YOU for making this available."
2,The plates came quickly and were exactly what we were looking for... the cost was great compared to what everyone else was charging... great company and highly recommend them to everyone...
2,"This is a fantastic movie full of atmosphere and some real food for thought. In fact, it is extremely well done all around. The acting in particular by Brian Donlevy as Quatermass is very realistic and convincing. I particularly liked the mood setting cinematography by Gerald Gibbs and James Bernard's score. It goes without saying that the script by director Val Guest succeeded on many levels making it engaging to a wide audience. I found this film to be both entertaining and thought provoking. Val Guest really knows how to set the mood."
1,"The phone charger is pretty standard & works fine. However the phone case is very poorly crafted, and looks like it was made very hastily. The phone lid won't even close properly. I was too embarassed to even send it back. The charger alone was probably worth the ten bucks so that's why I kept both items. I guess I was lured to this item by the price, but as the saying goes you get what you pay for."
1,"Wireless Extender Cell Phone Signal Booster Dual Band YX510 PCS/CEL. Followed instructions to antenna placement. Cell phone signal only got a small boost if placed almost on top of base unit. Enclosed broucher claims we could upgrade the booster and get a better signal for an additional $100+ After a $300 outlay for almost no improvement, I was not about to spend any more. Returned the item."
1,"Everyone seems to think that Maya Angelou is a great author. In my opinion, there has never been a worse book written. Even the style of writing put me to sleep. If I were reading a good story, written in her style, I wouldn't enjoy it. Usually I only use these reviews to say how good many books are, but I felt that this one was bad enough to warrant warning the world about what an awful piece of literature it is."
1,"A major disappointment. Geared towards adolescent boys, with attention spans of moths. Unsuitable for younger children. Frames rush by so fast one can barely register what is on the sceen, boring, and violent (at least two scenes of wild dogs eating smaller animals.) No depictions of nature's gentle, funny side. My four year old daughter and I hated it. Don't waste your money."
1,Ordered it Jan 9th and still havent received it :(( What the heck???? I dont get it....someone tell me why
1,"Highly overrated. I would expetct better from such talented artists, especially since Led Zeppelin and Bad Company are two of my favorite groups."
1,"I have eaten restaurant quality bisque and this is not it. You can see the bits of minced crab, but the batch I received had no flavor. I added spices and a generous splash of half and half which improved it somewhat. I canceled my subscribe and save subscription. I also read the reviews for their other products and seems one either loves them or doesn't. Ending on a positive note, their label is made w/ certified green paper and vegetable inks and the cans are made from recycled steel which I thought was impressive."
1,"Having watched a 1-hour version of this film several years ago on TV, I was elated at finding out the complete version was on DVD. So much for the good news. When I started watching it I thought something was wrong with my DVD player; unfortunately (or fortunately!) there was nothing wrong with the player... the quality of the transfer is just horrible, equal to a very worn out VHS tape. For the price this is going for, it's highway robbery. You've been warned. By the way, the film is excellent... the sequence at Babi Yar is ver poignant. Hopefully someday the film will get a decent remastering. 5 stars for the film; 0 stars for the DVD. Too bad."
2,"Great movie but there's not anything special about the Collectors edition version. If you're a fan of comedy, John Belushi, John Candy, Dan Akroid...you'll love it."
2,"It doesn't really matter if you consider yourself a right-winged conservative or a free-thinking liberal; this book remains a very compelling explanation of the family centered conservative position. The author represents a large portion of our American population and, therefore, cannot be lightly dismissed. This is an important book to read at this difficult time in our nation's history. Conservatives will find this book absolutely inspiring and liberals may discover in it a marvelous opportunity to exercise their tolerance for diversity. I'm buying more copies of this book to share with my adult children because of the practical advice the author provides for raising a culturally rich family. I really encourage everyone to read this book."
1,Just like his commercials. He says a lot without really telling you anything. Pure quackery.
2,"This was the FIRST book that I picked out and my parents bought for me when I was very young. It still holds a special place in my heart. Now that I'm an educator this book means even more to me. It shows children to be happy with what they look like and enjoy their childhood. The repetition in the book also helps young readers comprehend the story. And lets face it, the book is just fun! :)"
2,"I liked and disliked this book. Mann has his character, Aschenbach, preach a little more than I like, preaching his thoughts about beauty and writing and control. That's what I disliked. For the first third of the book, I could barely force myself to keep reading. Then Aschenbach falls in love and begins to tail the object of his affection all over Venice. The story takes a different turn and the writing moves from a rant about virtue to a real story. Venice is beautifully depicted and Aschenbach becomes a real, brilliant, tortured human being. That's what I liked."
1,"My configuration:Dell Inspiron 8500Windows XP ProNetGear WGR614 Wireless RouterNetGear WG511 Wireless PC CardPrinter: HP PSC2210xi all-in-oneI had read the reviews here on Amazon and was a bit leery of buying one of these things, but I really needed a wireless printer setup without having to keep a dedicated print server computer on all the time. The concept sounded good so I decided to try it out and see if it really worked. Well, after following the instructions to the letter, I was quite disappointed. The printer would not print anything except for the diagnostic test message from the bi-admin software provided by Linksys. It's been a week with fiddling with the software, uninstalling/reinstalling drivers, updating firmware, etc. but the thing still doesn't work. The Linksys website has sparse information on troubleshooting too. Didn't bother with Linksys tech support since their reputation is pretty bad here. I am returning this product."
1,"A quarter of the way through this movie my wife asked me why we were wasting our life watching it. Unfortunately I said we should stick with it to see what happens, and all that happened was pure sillyness. I can't believe these actors would be part of something like this!"
1,"I read several reviews that said they loved the electric vibration of this item. I got one based on those reviews, I was sorry I did. It is very loud and vibrates too hard!! Nothing relaxing about it at all!! I'll use it without the thing turned on I guess."
1,This is a beautiful CD but it is NOT Carrie Underwood singing. Country Piano Tribute is just that - piano music. I guess I had thought it would be Carrie singing with only piano accompanying her.
2,"Perfect for knocking beads, closes nicely without crushing them. Tricky to hold if you have larger hands., But works well."
2,"THis is a very good game, i did not give it five stars because, as people say, it is really a 2 or more player game and i often dont have that, with just one player it can sometimes be very boring, but in all other respects this game is very good, the courses are interestinbg, the minigames different, the air ride machines are very different, and it is very good overall for a spinioff."
1,"This was the first time I've had any issues with buying textbooks through Amazon. There wasn't any communication with this vender, the charge came out of my account two different times (one was replaced) and it took me about 3 weeks to get my book (I've never had it take more than 5 days). I wouldn't recommend."
2,"No, it's not pure progressive rock. BUT, these are very good pop songs with progressive/art rock flourishes and excellent songwriting, singing, and playing."
2,I used this for a long time and it never gave me any problem. One good thing about it is the cooking rice stay good for a very long time without becoming stale or spoiled. Brown rice cooking is great too.
2,"By the day she was Lady Sabrina Verrick, exquisite belle of high society. By night she was a criminal, Bonni Charlie, the lawless highwayman whose notoriety rang the length and breadth of the 18th century England.Wounded and on the run, hunted like an animal through the night, Sabrina's wild career drove her at last into the power of one man who was not afriad to tame her. Brutal, arrogant, he would hurt her, betray her, subdue her free spirit - but never admit that he loved her... (text refers to book's back cover)A very enjoyable book. Action packed and sensual too. I really enjoyed reading it. One of the best. I highly recommend it."
1,"This is a piece of crap. I wish we would have read the other reviews first. Finish is nasty, holes don't line up and parts are backward. DO NOT buy!"
1,"""Catherwood"" was recommended to our book group by another book group in town. I found it to be well written, but lacking a plot. It was as if someone found evidence that some woman wondered the woods in the 1600s and was found again, then the author decided to make a story of it. It was depressing and lacked substance. Don't waste your time."
2,For the price it brews a good cup of coffee. Full of programmable bells and whistles for the technically inclined. Only rough spot is in filling as the sweet spot for pouring in the water is small. Stands fairly high so you need an open space to set it up.
1,"This review is by a 42-year-old well-educated woman, married to the same man for almost 16 years. Three kids and a dog. Why did I buy the book? Because my husband and I don't know everything.Kim and Mark act as though they discovered sex.The book tells us explicitly what Kim likes Mark to do to her, and how long it takes.Amazing that a publisher would invest in this. (I am certain that it was only because of Kim's fame.)How embarrassing for Kim and her husband! (And their families!)My advice if you want to learn how to have GREAT sex: (1) read the kama sutra and/or romance novels (Really! Millions of women love these books for a reason. I recommend the authors Jane Feather and J.D. Robb (the Eve and Roark series: HOT, HOT, HOT!) for starters -- just read the sex parts if you don't like the rest of the book; and the Red Sage Publishing series) and (2) practice with your spouse. A lot."
2,"This is the type of fence stretcher we've used on our last 40 miles of barbed wire fence. This one is to replace that old one which is still fine for mending fence. I have another 7 miles to build with this stretcher this summer. The jaws and springs eventually wear out, but are replaceable. Good piece of equipment."
1,"I had memories of how much my wife had enjoyed playing 7th Guest and 1th Hour. I thought that I would buy this for her to install on her computer but, alas, found that I could not install it on her machine running Windows XP; not even in compatability mode. Seems that the game ties itself to specific sound and video cards. Oh well, it was a nice thought."
1,"If you learn best by repetition, this is the book for you! He states the same concept, or lunch appointment with ""rich dad"" over and over again. Sometimes I went back in the book to see if I lost my place, but no, he just keeps on saying the same thing over and over again (didn't I just say that?). I'm disappointed."
2,"Paul McCusker writes the i've ever read.I loved this book about a different world full of unexpected twists and tunrns that will leave you dazzled,dazed,and writing emails to Paul McCusker and asking him to write more books of the same."
1,"This was tricky to set up, in part because the documentation is horrible.Some of the 'boosters' posting reviews here gloss over the fact that the WMB must be connected to the PC via ethernet for the initial setup wizard (which disconnects that PC from access to the router, which makes getting the router info a little tricky). It's only after that setup that you move it to your living room / entertainment center and connect it to speakers.My biggest complaint is with the performance. I'm getting audio dropouts (one-second gaps in playback) at the rate of about 1 per minute. The audio quality is not very good (there's no documentation about whether the audio is being re-encoded before the wireless transmission, but I'm almost certain it is - and not with very high quality). And the integration with different media players is spotty."
2,"The book my side of the mountain was an interesting book It's about a boy named Sam Griggley who runs away from his crowded New York house to live in the catskill mountains.There he finds animal companions,and his great grandfathers farm.In my opininion I think that everybody in a 10-13 age group shold read it.He trains a falcon,makes his own house.twords the end you'll see a dramatic change in his attitude.The end will suprise you very much but that is all I 'm goining to say."
2,"Orgy's debut cd Candyass is awesome. I love their sound because it is hard to find bands that combine the varitiy of sounds that they do. I think that anyone who likes metal, industrial rock, or maybe even electronica should buy this! Videodrone is also really good."
2,"I love this series, and wish that it would have gone on past 3 seasons! I'm glad to own it so that I can revisit it whenever I want."
2,"I've been a Morphine fan for quite a while. And when I heard the news of Mark Sandman's (the singer)death, I feared the worst...NO MORE MEZMERIZING BEAUTY from the guys of Morphine. I recieved ""The Night"" on its release date and listened to it three times right away. While as a whole, While The Night is not the best of ""Morphine's"" albums (this album is different enough to be in a category itself)...there are songs on the disc that will become legendary to Morphine fans. The album is simply ""Chilling"". You get the usual Morphine dose of sax, bass, drum and VOICE...but with a new twist. There are some unique sounds on this album that just adds to the sad feeling one gets when the thought reaches the brain: ""Where would Morphine had gone if Mark Sandman had not traveled into THE NIGHT?"" Thank you Mark...for the beauty."
1,"I will have to say that for the first 1 1/2 years this was great. I cooked my waffles evenly and beeped when it was ready. When I pulled it out to use it a few weeks ago it would not cook my waffles evenly. The bottom browned perfectly but the top just would not cook. I tried everything... I changed my recipe, plugged it in another plug, I even bought a new one. However, the new one cooked the same way. I am not sure if it is an element or what but I will be returning the new one and throwing out the old one. Now I am on a mission to find another brand. My kids are missing their waffles."
1,"Don't get me wrong, ""Harriet the Spy,"" was one of my all time favorite books (and movies), growing up. I'm almost 26 now and had always wanted to read ""The Long Secret,"" So after re-reading Harriet, I went to the bookstore and ordered myself a copy. Well, at first it wasn't so bad, but there really wasn't any real point to the story. Harriet hadn't matured much at all, and to make matters worse, really offensive and hostile notes were left all over the place. I am also a Christian and find it offensive that the phrase ""Jesus Hates You,"" should be allowed to be published in a Children's book. This is especially true in this day and age, when almost any threat has the potential to turn violent.Skip this one."
1,"The book seems to be a raw summary of what the authors read and gathered from statistical reviews and reports about new trends in customer services and e-commerce. I found the book to be composed of some really interesting statistics and facts but rather trivial ideas.Too many words to express simple ideas and too many copy and paste from chapter to chapter.... My college professor would not grade it as an A-, I guess."
1,her voice gets higher and higher in this one.i had to turn it off. i felt her anxiety coming through the speakers
1,The chairs are weak and will not support the average man's weight. This chair was probably ony built for decoration and not for everyday use.
1,"I love The Firm! I own lots of The Firm videos and use them nearly everyday. This one is my least favorite. I don't have the Sculpting Stick & am not interested in purchasing it. I have The Fanny Lifter, The Firm Box, and my weights. In my opinion, the Sculpting Stick kind of seems like an additional piece of equipment you have to buy that you really shouldn't need in order to get a good workout.I found myself tripping up a lot with this video."
1,"Besty Taylor is have a bad day. First she loses her job and then she loses her life. A few days later she wakes up in casket in a pink suite (a color she would not be caught dead in) and her step-monster cast off shoes. Now Besty has gone from being undead and unwed to being the Queen of the Vampires, a job that brings a whole new set of problems.I really wanted to like ""Undead and Unwed"" by Mary Janice Davidson but I could not. I found the character to be boring and interesting. Some may like this book but I was not one of them."
2,"I've been wearing loose glasses for quite a bit and I was too lazy to go to a glass shop to get it fixed. This set has all sizes you need to work on small items, fix glasses, pocket knives etc. You get all you need for around 10 dollars."
1,"In the times of Cabal, Weaveworld, Imajica, The Thief Of Always, and The Books of the Art Barker was one of the best author's of his time. Galilee is a complete letdown for all of us and a softie for someone like Barker. Along with Sacrament these are his two ""mushy books"" and I myself dont recommend them."
1,the condition of the book was horrible ... i paid 77$ for that book .. other online book stores had better deals but i thought its amazon ... i will try and never buy anything from this place...
1,"The graphics are excellent on my labtop, but not on my XP. The show jumping is quite challenging. And its sometimes gets boring when you do the same thing each day. It is nothing like the movie.I liked it because there is a lot of horses to pick from. You can't make your horse look like Sonya because the color on the game is lighter than Sonya."
2,Somewhat skeptical about this until I used it. Works great for those unexpected times when the internal battery runs down. I would not recommend it for times when you need the GPS though - it drains those AA batts really quick.
2,The Alarm Clock Radio works well and has good sound quality. I bought it based a lot on looks and the fact that it still had a CD Player with it instead of an IPod Dock. Also it looked to be good quality unlike some of the other CD player alarm clocks sold in stores.
2,"I own a 1973 Nova SS, and this book told me the history on my baby, along with how the Nova became famous. This book will give a beginner all the info they need to know and let the enthusiests in on a couple of secrets. I definately enjoyed this book! For any person who loves Novas will love this book!"
1,"I bought this book, but it turned out that I didn't really have to use much of it. The source program package from apache comes with a complete, up-to-date installation guide, online docs, pointers to FAQ and other info. If you are trying to set up Apache in the absense of any internet access (some kind of a boot-strapping process that someone might have to do in some special settings), this book might be useful. But that's usually not the case, and I wonder who would bother? For quick reference purposes, O'Reilley's Webmaster in a Nutshell would do a much better job for dollar."
1,I'm in a trouble in writing my opinion on this book. I ordered it September 24th 2010 but I still have not received it. My complaints to Amazon are all in vain. Sorry.
2,"This is a super cool phish patch! I sewed it onto the front of my fleece & it looks super cool! Very nice colors, great quality product!"
2,"This is a must have for anyone who need ""visual aide"". This can be watched any time."
2,"I've never learned so much from a tarot deck!For one, I'm learning so many different systems of meaning. Numerology, mythology, symbolism (druidic/wiccan/traditional tarot especially) -- it all applies, depending on what the card or spread calls for. The artwork is intutive, so you don't need to know these systems in order to understand the cards, but it makes for a lot of fun!For another, I see the cards' dynamics in daily life. This is without daily card draws, too! I'm getting insight into human behavior especially, both others' and my own. It's like learning psychology without the clinical definitions. I wouldn't use it to diagnose people, of course, but I do like seeing the patterns.This is a great deck for the artwork alone, even without all the stuff you can learn. Buy it!"
1,this product works but the case fell apart when i removed from package. i recommend you pay a few bucks more and get the $6 one it is a lot more solidly built and doesnt feel so cheap. it also fit the USB socket alot more solidly.
2,"It is a very hight quality set of plug wires, however, I do not know how Accel is using the term ""ceramic"". My previous wires were Champion Ceramic which had actual ceramic protectors around the spark plug book. Eventually though the boots fell apart inside the ceramic sleeves.The Champions were $150 and lasted about 4 years. The $90 Accel advertised as ceramic but the boots simply have some type of silver spray paint like coating on them. I am hopeful they will last longer than the Champion."
2,"I had been looking for a sleeve for months that would fit my Dell Studio 17 with 9 cell extended battery. None of the other neoprene sleeves I tried fit it without really stretching the limits of the stitching but it fits perfectly in this one. It even has an interior nylon sort of fabric lip that slips over the edge of the laptop once it's in the sleeve to ensure it won't accidentally slide out when you unzip the sleeve. I use it as a sleeve inside my backpack because the original backpack slot would not fit the larger 17"" widescreen Dell Studio. Strongly recommend this sleeve for the XL laptops like mine."
1,"Save-states... or atleast thats what we emulation gamers call them. So instead of having codes that do wierd and fun stuff like back in the Game Genie and Pro Action Replay days, they just sat a buncha guys in a room and made them play up to the last boss and record the saves? This isn't a new concept, Zophar's Domain and other sites have save states and I'm sure there's probably SOME way to put them back onto a memory cart... but to me that's kinda boring though, not as fun as making ""flying"" and ""power attack"" codes. What's the point in playing a save and beating the game, you miss all the story."
1,"This CD by Armor for Sleep has a really good beat and I really liked it when i was listening to it but when I read the lyrics, I was very disturbed. All the lyrics are about death and dying and it's very weird. Good for you if you're into that but not for me. It's a shame because the bands SOUNDS really cool but the lyrics suck."
1,These shoes are extremely tight and small and I have very petite feet. They are shaped funny and just are silly. No issues with shipping. I plan to return.
2,"Very informative about the history of Arab women and their writing. It follows the development of the Arab feminist novel and offers analysis on characters, themes, and plots."
2,"""All Fly Home"" by Al Jarreau, is a masterpiece to say the least. Al Jarreau is a master of song, story telling and passion. If you are interested in true interpretation, and an artisitic soul, check out ""All Fly Home"".IMC"
1,"I bought th ese for my son. His comments were:""They don't stay in my ears""""They don't sound as good as the cheaper SONY earphones I have"""
2,great value and speakers had them for a long time still work like the first day i got them. Dont use that much battery power in fact they get about 1 set of batteries=30+ hours. you should definatley buy yhem
2,"This is a good vacuum, and as far as I can tell, it does a good job, especially on our wool rugs. From previous reviews, I was a little worried about the weight factor. The vacuum doesn't seem all that heavy until you lean it back and turn it on. Then you realize how heavy it is in your arm. Now I see what the previous reviewers were talking about. I can't picture that smaller and older people should consider this vacuum as it would be too heavy for them. And if you have stairs, forget it. Too heavy and awkward. But it does do a good job, so if you're younger and stronger, go for it."
2,"This show is just amazing. Taking place in Oxford, England, all the criminals are smart. Lewis is the lead in this show and he is an old school detective in an academic's world. Hatthaway, his partner, was an academic and is very well educated. As Lewis says in one episode, together they make a pretty good detective. The two partners have great chemistry, but their taste in women seem to be not so good. The crimes are complex and very difficult to suss out. If you are looking for a smart show, give this one a watch!"
1,"These tools are meant to be given to someone as a joke I think, not for anyone to do anything meaningful around a home. They are made of flimsy plastic and weak metal. The screws I have encountered in my home were more durable than the screwdriver head -- the metal on the tool stripped up rather than the screw, so the tools were ruined in first use. The drill is a complete joke since it has zero power to even assemble pre-drilled holes for screws -- again, the screw lasted longer than the drill bit. VERY, VERY disappointed in this. I'm sure someone else out there has pink tools for women that are not a complete flop. Why else would there be people selling their used sets from this very web-site!"
2,"Nothing is perfect. I enjoyed it. And, if you enjoyed Alice Seebold's creative fiction fantasy ""Lovely Bones"", maybe it's just me, but I think you'll love Norman Thomas Remick's creative nonfiction fantasy ""West Point..."". If you are one of those naysayers of ""Lovely Bones"" who liked the presentation idea but not the storyline, I suggest that you might appreciate Remick's book which a similar presentation idea, but a storyline that is from real nonfictional history. Nevertheless, don't just go by what I say. Get the books and see for yourself."
1,"I phoned the company and found that this microscope only comes with a two year warranty. I found similar microscopes online for the same price that offer a lifetime warranty, and I ended up purchasing one from the Home Training Tools site."
1,"This product is not an original.The materials are cheap,Weber makes quality products,and this is a generic.I'm very dissatisfied .This is a first for me.You always had been reliable.Gretchen Hile"
2,I'm puzzled as to why my 3rd listening changed my perspective of this DVD. The first two plays had some serious sound level and distortion problems and now it seems to be working ok. To a POINT. Her point!
2,These sunscreen wipes are AMAZING! The perfect amount of sunscreen on each wipe for one application and our norwegian/scottish/irish/german skin no longer gets sun burned! This is definitely the way sunscreen needs to go in the future!
1,"We were excited to purchase this product thinking it would look nice in our newly finished basement. The cheap-looking plastic is reminiscent of an infant tub. Painting it would not work well either since the texture is speckled. After having many guests give negative feedback, we decided it would be much better to put in a drywall niche. Also, note in the product description that ALL SALES ARE FINAL and NO RETURNS ALLOWED."
2,Helpful companion for basic understanding of Office software. Good to have on hand to help refresh memory for certain functions.
2,Love the movie. Into horror movies and this one is good. Keep up the good work so I can order more.
2,"This is a very good RF & Microwave engineering book.It combines a clear explanation of the basics with aseries of new different kinds of devices (in chapters4, 7-13). This makes this book equally useful forstudents and for experienced engineers.This book also integrates the basic analysis of widerange of passive devices (reciprocal andnonreciprocal) with essential reference information inthe main text and in the Appendixes. In addition, aseries of important real applications with practicaldetails are included.I do give these book 5 stars because it does help youunderstand passive RF and microwave devices much better."
1,"As a Price fan, I had to get these two classics. When the DVD arrived I anxiously poped it out of it's case, put it in the DVD player, and hit the play button. The sound was scratchy, there was an annoying white glow in the lower right corner of the screen, and the original film the DVD was produced from must have been used as a cat scratching post. I swear that the DVD was made from a video tape shot in a cinema off the moviue screen - it's that ad. At first I thought this was as good as the quality got for this movie. Then I saw it on the SciFi Channel - the quality was excellent, sound was perfect, etc.So if you want it for the movies, it's OK. As for quality, it's the WORST DVD I have seen to date - and I own over 150!"
1,"While the high end Riedel glasses are very nice, this set didn't even come close to my expectations. I thought I was getting a nice entry-level set of high quality glasses I could give as a gift. What I got was an undersized, clunky set of glasses that I could have gotten for $9.99 from Target. A total disappointment."
2,"Don't know how we ever lived without this. It's great for pancakes, eggs, hamburgers and just about anything you need to cook. We don't even use our stove anymore since getting this. It's easy to clean too. Highly recommend this product. It's great."
1,"This unit worked OK after purchasing but was not good at all refrigerating items (always luke warm). After a little over a year, the unit started making noises when the refrigerator tried to cool and then it started leaking like crazy. I finally go a hold of Soleus tech support (totally useless!) and they basically told me that it was probably cracked or the tubes (still don't know where these are!) disconnected somehow although the unit was never moved since I got it! After reading all the reviews here, I would NEVER recommend this cheaply made product!"
2,"Great upgrade from the BFME 2, every faction has become stronger than before. For Example, The Men of the West have more range from the fortress, so they can build their walls farther out, in effect, more farms more resources but more land to cover"
1,"This is singularly the worst iPod player I've ever encountered. I purchased it for use at work, and it's given me nothing but headaches. The main problems center around the remote, which to say is unresponsive would be putting it mildly. Most buttons have to be hit at least twice to do what you want, and it's not unusual for a button to do the exact opposite of its intended purpose. Then, every few songs or so, when you're skipping ahead or back, it makes this BRRR! sound followed by a high-pitched whine, and takes several seconds before proceeding to the next song.I'm extremely sorry I purchased this device, and I would strongly advise others from making the same mistake."
2,"If you're a fan of the Monty Python Show, this is one movie you must not miss. Sociopathic, insane, oddball humor surround it's adventure plot. Hoo boy, you have to watch it to understand...this movie left me devestated in laughter, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys movies that lacks sanity.Nee! END"
1,This ink set does not fit the MFC-465CN! The box once it arrives clearly does not include the MFC-465CN on the list and it is a different form factor than the LC51CL ink set you really need! i bought two sets of these that do not fit. Do not waste you time/money on this one. It is particularly annoying that amazon includes a popup that says it does fit. It does not!
2,"CD arrived very quickly with no damages as it came very well packaged, it had also a reasonable and competitive price, will buy again for sure, I am very satisfied with service."
2,This book is so helpful in many ways. It is very informative and written by a patient and a doctor helps see both sides. I recommend this for anyone taking this medication for any reason.
2,"I'm not going to lie, I didn't get to read too much of this because in just getting to know my daughter I kept forgetting to even look at the book. But when I was curious about something like what age she may start to try and crawl at, I was able to go through the book and find useful tips and any information I needed. Its good if you're planning to really pay attention to it but not exactly necessary all the time."
2,I really enjoyed this video. I actually don't do the same video continuously but this was good. The aerobics segment was at a pace I could do it wasn't very complicated. I have some of Donna's videos and this one in my opinion is one of the best!! Great Job Donna!!
2,"Like other reviewers have noted, the brand varies (can't remember what I received) I was concerned about the quality considering the price, but it is on par with the sets I have spend considerably more money for.In my experience these things wear out in about 6 months to a year, so I'll be back in that time for another one."
2,"Bought this for my 6 year old son who picked this item.As we know, costumes for the halloween are made of cheap materials.There is no docs like manual but I could figure it out by looking at the big picture of red ninja in the package.I think this has good price for the purpose compared to other online shops."
1,"MSI is a con man who started a cult and lures people in with some delightful books (like this one) and courses. Once you sign-up for the cult, you go through 6 months of classic brain-washing. But it doesn't hold - most members leave before 3 years when they slowly realize it is all a scam.Read First Thunder at your own peril."
1,"Did not grind meat well. i dont know if mine was faulty or not, but it worked terrible. i thought that maybe the connective tissue in the meat was clogging it up so i cleaned it out.after about an hour of removing all connective tissue from several pounds of venison i tried to run it back through and it didnt work any better. i considered it not even worth cleaning up, so i threw it away."
2,"Davis' books are always well researched and written. This book is a travelogue of the Roman Mediterranean provinces, a discussion about gladiators, and finally a mystery about a dead lion whom the Emperor Vaspasian used as his executioner. I enjoyed all three parts, but only wish there had been more tension and drama."
1,"The graphics are impressive, however, when interacting with other characters a window pops up and you basically have to read and click as a means for interaction. There is a main window with text that represents the response of the character you are interacting with, and on the right there are headings that read rumors, where are you from, etc... I find this interaction to be totally archaic so I was totally unimpressed by this gameplay. Also, after you have clicked on all of the options on how to communicate with the character and you click on goodbye, as you are leaving the character will say, ""Can I help you"", or something to that affect. Didn't I just exhaust every question with this guy? What else do I need to speak about?Also, the fighting in this game is really dissapointing. You hit then he hits, you hit then he hits...get the point? Yawn....I believe this game would have been the greatest game ever made if it came out ten years ago.Definately try before you buy."
2,"The thing I love about McKillip is that she can draw the reader into a dream-like fairy world, and this book is no different. It is hard to decide what is real and what is not, to that point that it feels very much like a dream. Most writers cannot pull this off, to create a true dream atmosphere, but McKillip does this in this book. The story is tragic, yet with a happy ending, and the whole book is done well, the people in the book are interesting and well done, and as a whole this is one of the best non-adventure fantasy books, best read by mature readers. (Not neccisaryly older)."
1,"""Nor have I ever felt that the surrender at Appomattox was an absolute military necessity. I think that in holding Richmond, and even in consenting to that surrender, Lee sacrificed his judgment as a soldier to his duty as a citizen and the leader of the South. I think Lee deserves honor for that, for if he had left Richmond when Sherman invaded Georgia, it would have given us another year of war."" US Grant - as quoted in Travels with Grant Volume 2, page 627, by John R. Young, 1879. A very beautiful book with many engravings.If Winik can explain this, I'll buy a copy of his book for everyone in my family - 7 copies."
2,"Back in the ""dark ages"" (1980's), our son's first backpack (brown suede) served us well. When it became damaged (no, I don't recall the specifics), with only a little optimism, I decided to try out its ""lifetime guarantee"".Much to our surprise, the uncomplicated and speedy process greatly rewarded us! Not only did a little boy in elementary school become a life-long customer, but his parents, also, have long enjoyed the benefits of the World of Jansport.Undoubtedly, I would've been a much happier elementary student in the 50's, (yes, the 1950's), if I'd had this kind of ""book satchel""!BTW, if I'm not mistaken, my son (age 37) still has that bag, which he uses to store ""valuables"" at home."
2,Violin is very nice. Stays in tune. Didn't have to change the strings. Works great for my daughters first year of orchestra.
1,Where is Kirk in this album? There are no solos in this album. Lars drumming is tight but that ringing noise gets annoying after awhile. Sounds like he's hitting pots and pans. The good side is this is definitely a heavier album and it's a with good rhythm guitars from James. The lyrics needs a little work. This album sounds incomplete and should of spent more time in the studio because it almost sounds like nu-metal.
1,"This really doesn't match up to Castle of Cagliostro. Lupin isn't as funny or wacky or as hyperactive. The scenery and music are uninspired and plot just isn't interesting.The only good thing about this 'un is the nudity (only in the uncut version) provided by Fujiko. It helped spice up some of the tedious scenes. CoC had a formidable villian and set up the movie for some imaginative set-pieces. The locations in TSoTG are not very vivid or engaging.Zenigata, Goemon and Jigen don't even provide decent sideshow entertainment this time. It's like they were just filling a contractual obligation by appearing.The DVD is in full-frame with Dolby Stereo sound. It has a decent amount of extras, including quite a few trailers. But one curious thing. There is no chapter selection on the disc or timecode displayed on the player once inserted. Though you can still skip to the next scene number using the remote."
2,"""The Honor of the Queen"" is a triumph. There is simply no other word for the powerful effect of this book. His characters have so much depth, his descriptions have so much punch, and his vision has so much detail that you are drawn into the gravity well of a story from which even light could not escape.I don't take the time to write on-line reviews of books I thought were ""okay""; I'm submitting this review to tell anyone who loves a great story that the whole Honor Harrington series is well worth checking out."
1,"If you're looking for a detailed history of tank weapontry, this book is not for you. One of the few I ever sent back. I thought that it would contain details on the main guns, sights and gunnery techniques each country used during WWII. It seems that much of the material here was already covered in David Fletcher's ""Tank Scandal"" volume 1& 2. If you are looking for a primer on tanks in WWII, it's ok."
2,"This lock is strong, inexpensive and easy to carry. It would be better if it was longer, but for my needs, it's OK. I should say, I am pretty happy with it."
2,"""Remember the Titians"" is a realistic feature that triggers a lot of emotions, and it demands a good soundtrack. But good doesn't even do justice to this; GREAT is more like it1 You'll almost forget you're listening to a movie soundtrack, more like a typical recollection of 70's hits. ""Aint No Mountain High Enough"" and ""Na Na Na Na"" steal the show; also noteable are ""I Want to Take You Higher"" and ""Spirit in the Sky"". On another note completly, this is one of Disney's best soundtracks for a live action feature EVER--keep it up, Disney! Usually, soundtracks for live-action movies just include instrullmental tracks, and don't appeal to many people as albums to purchase. But this one ROCKS DOWN THE HOUSE! I wish ALL of today's live action movies turned out such good music. Don't you agree?"
2,This is actually a prescribed item for rehab after a hip surgery. The rotation exercises are very helpful and this light weight block is very easy to use in my workout standing with one foot on it and rotating opposite leg. Range of motion is better using it. I'm pleased.
2,I am happy with the reasponse from Amazon. I had no problems with the book or the service.
1,"One of my kitties LOVED this toy, and the other kitty couldn't care less.This morning the kitty that loves this toy got horribly tangled up in the toy. The bungee wrapped around her paw and when kitty tried to get it off, it just got tighter, cutting off circulation. It was very difficult to restrain her and cut the bungee string off.Just a warning - this can be a fun toy, but have careful supervision!"
1,"I bought this. It is not worth $9 much less $39. The ties tore off and the wood poked holes in it, and all of that happened the first time we put it over wood in the rack. The cover is not as thick as a tarp from my local hardward store."
2,It is pretty much samsung version of chocolate phone except for no touch screen and 150 dollars cheaper. It has MP3 and most of all it is free if you sign up for 2 years.
1,"This guidebook contains useful information for the places highlighted by the author. It's coverage of Spain, however, is limited to the author's specific itinerary. I would expect any guidebook that has ""Spain"" as it's title to at least provide cursory coverage of Valencia and the Costa Blanca region in eastern Spain. These areas are not even mentioned."
1,"Jeff Dunham is great. I really love his stuff. However, when I purchased the other DVDs they had the option to watch it censored or uncensored. This one does not. I would have liked it much more if I could have had the opportunity to see that version as well."
2,A continuation of the Belisarius saga doesn't leave much to be desired. The interplay of the characters is fascinating and wonderful.
1,"I was very excited to use this cookbook, as I've made all of my 10-month-old's food since he started eating solids at 6 months. I was interested in finding some new and different recipes, so I thought I'd give this book a try after reading other reviews. I enjoyed some of the first few chapters, which talked about everything from food safety and the nutrients in food to organic vs. non-organic. Unfortunately, I've found the recipes to be terrible. Not one I've tried has turned out; they've been awful. I consider myself to be a fairly good home cook. I cook every day and make many recipes for our family from foodnetwork.com and epicurious.com that come out perfectly. I follow the recipes in this book exactly, but nothing I've tried has been worth eating, and it's so frustrating to waste such good, organic ingredients! I wouldn't recommend this book. If you want a wonderful baby food cookbook, try Tyler Florence's book: Start Fresh."
1,"The DVD arrived on time but unfortunately I did not notice that the DVD was PAL or UK brand. Therefore my present was not viewable on our DVD player.SO, my advice is to read the whole red print."
1,"I've been using spinning DVDs for years. I love Mindy Mylrea's Spinning DVDs. This is actually the first workout DVD I've ever bought including those for pilates, yoga, stretching, that I've regretted. IT IS NOT A WORKOUT. The reviewer who labeled it as ""crap"" was right. Don't bother. SOOOOO not worht it.Who works out to classical music??? Please. Plus even the sound/video quality seemed cheap."
2,"I have read this book several times, as well as listened to the audio version. I recommend the entire series to anyone interested in how politics truly work. And how families work. And oh yes, it is also about Ancient Rome, but the similarities to the political workings of today cannot be over looked. The author takes a few liberties with history, but not so much that it irritates historians, and she freely admits how she manipulates and why. Read this series!"
2,"Awesome product. These knee braces have helped reduce my knee pain while running. I have tried 2 other brands. But, nothing has worked like this one."
2,These shoes are well made. Sturdy yet light. Very comfortable to wear. I had a couple of pairs of other Helly Hansen shoes. Always satisfied.
1,This book is the worst test prep. It actually has errors in the test that are unacceptable. It caused much confusion to have errors in the test which threw me off. Don't buy this book and save yourself the money.
1,"The book alternates between unintentional humor and tedium. Tedium when the characters are sitting around earnestly explaining their endtimes theology to each other. Hysterically funny when people are being hypnotized and the so-called ""prophecies"" are being ""fulfilled"" in such a predictably lame fashion...and the UN moves to...BABYLON! Whoa, dude. What a mess. Please remember. This is not theology. It is particularly silly fiction. All of this rapture/millenarianism, etc...stuff is a very late development in Christian thinking, and is held by a very small minority of Christians worldwide. This literary and spiritual garbage does NOT define Christianity."
2,Shocked that this actually worked. I bought it skeptically - and was so impressed. I will continue to use for tv maintainability throughout our homes' tvs. It took out a huge black burn out spot.Get it.It works.
2,"This album is FABULOUS. I have basically listened to nothing else for the past month - the harmonies, the rich voices, the lyrics that really strike a chord. Their agent should be shot for allowing that photo to appear on the album cover, but the music - WOW. You will not be disappointed - especially if you were a fan of theirs back in the day."
2,We purchased this train set for our 3yr old for Christmas and he absolutley loves it! We set it up the night before on a train table that we had purchased on craigslist and painted it (looked brand new and for 1/4 of the original price!). We did our best to conceal the present but he was so curious what was under the cover that we had placed over it. Once he saw it there was no going back. He played with it all day and night which was kind of nice for me since I had a lot of cleaning/cooking to do for Christmas dinner. Your child will love this item!It comes with many extra tracks and is easy for you or your child to change the design of the layout.Now for my con on this product. The tracks fall off the supports very easily and can leave your child frustrated. I am purchaing double sided tape tonight and will hopefully fix that issue. I dont want to glue the supports down since I want my son to be able to move things around as he wants. Other than that I love the product!
2,"i thought that this dvd was incredible. i would recommend it for any evanescence fan, or if youre looking for new music and dont know where to start...start here! truly amazing dvd set in the zenith in paris, and you get a look at the true evanescence behind their hardcore facade."
2,Even though my daughter has never been sick I have used the information in this book to help keep her well when all of the children around her did get sick. And it's not just for children I have used this book for my husband when he was ill. This book was recemmended to me by a mom of four and I have recommended it to many of my friends.
1,"While this printer is indeed better than many, it still has a long, long way to go to compete with your analog print producer on the corner. You *will* see grain and red-saturated prints in spite of your best efforts. If you must have an Epson, they offer comparable quality sub [price]"
1,"Pretty flimsy. Looks good from the images, but I wouldn't buy this again. I think I'll stick to buying items like these from a physical store so I really know what I'm gettin."
1,I ordered this item. After a long wait. I was informed that the item was not available for sale. Bad Business
2,"I purchased this set of 6 to replace those lost over time. These were perfect, and exactly matched my existing forks. I didn't notice any difference in size or weight, and the logo on the back of each fork is the same as my existing Oneida set."
2,"Angelseyes is an amazing product -- just a small amount on my dog's food once a day makes his muzzle snow white -- no more brown stains, no matter what dog food he eats."
2,"I've owned a similar set of these for 8 years that came from the dealer when I bought my car. They've been great and totally trouble free so I bought these for my old truck after recently purchasing new tires/wheels. These fit great on the longer studded 3/4 ton and 1 ton axles. Let's not kid each other - if a real thief wants your tires/wheels there are relatively easy ways for them to get any wheel lock off. For the modest price, however, why not try to at least deter the casual thief? These fit the bill, look great and come with a great warranty.Cheers!"
2,"I have to say I am a fan of this series. This installment in the series is a very good read. The characters are well written and believable. OK,having said that the numerous malapropisms made by the main character were a bit excessive in this book. In previous books they were fewer and more believable. Overall if you are looking for an nice read for the beach, airplane or bedtime this book is a good choice."
1,"The Book had a good Plot. The way the characters where represented where horrible. You should have gotten to know them better, the author should have spent more time on the description of the characters personalities, and details of the story then just concentrating on the plot."
1,"Malcolm Crow is a child psycholigist, but one of his patientse kills himself and shoots Malcolm, he wants to succeed with his next one. His next child is Cole, a young boy who can see dead people. At first Malcolm doesn't believe the boy but he starts to help him out and slowly beging to believe the boy. Malcolm is also having problems with his wife, she doesn't seem to love him that much anymore. Ok, what is the deal with this movie, it's not bad but it's not great. It's no where near as good as it's made out to be nor is it scary. The ending is really predictable, I can't believe no one saw it coming. The movie has some good points, a few good sub plots involving a dead girl tring to call Cole for help. This movie would of been alot better if the plot wasn't known, but it was, Malcolm spend the first half of the movie trying to figure out what is wrong with the kid, it would of been better if we didn't know beforehand either."
2,"This film is entirely entertaining and has a true magic to it which is sadly gone from the films of the 90's. It is, as a work of fantasy, the most engaging and rewarding cinema experience since the days of Jason and the Argonauts. It challenges you to conceive of the incredible imagery presented and also to think as two halves of yourself at once; your simpler yet more life-affirming youth, and your complex, more discriminate adulthood.I refer to this film as Chapter One in the sense that it was the first of Gilliam's three films which deal with the concepts of fantasy and reality. Time Bandits involves a young boy who escapes his parents through his fantasies. Brazil, by far my favorite film of all time, is the second film, dealing with a man escaping harsh reality by his dreams. The final installment is the highly underrated Adventures of Baron Munchaussen, which is about an older man indulging the fantasic reality of his youth to fight off his impending end."
2,"Ok, my written english isn't good at all, but I'd just wanna say how much I love this book. I have been studying html and css for some time now, and I already knew something when I bought this book, and what I think great about it is that it's so detailed about how the things work in html, xhtml and css that it's like if I was learning everything from the beginning again, but this time knowing exactly what I was doing and why.Well, that's it.. sorry for my english."
1,"The look and feel of this camcorder is very good. Unfortunately my camcorder use is limited to low light indoor activities. For example, evening party, indoor school activities, kid drama and orchestra. This camcorder is not at all suitable for these activities. Earlier I had a Sony DCR TRV140, which was way better than this camcorder.This camcorder has a very small sensor and hence such a low price. One easy guide to evaluate the sensor size is to look at the optical zoom. Most of the camcorders with more than 10x optical zoom has small sensors. These large optical zoom camcorders will perform poorly in low light.If you are planning to use this camcorder in low indoor light, I do not recommend it."
1,"Ok, granted the Sopranos theme is great and what's a show about Italians gonna do - not feature Sinatra? Gettouttaheee!However, the rest of the CD doesn't quite work. Like many soundtracks, the music may have been appropriate for the particular scene or episode, but each track listened to one after another just clashes with the listener. Even more importantly, songs that *should* have been included are missing. Most notably is the dreamy, somber, Mazzy Star track ""Look on Down From the Bridge"" used during the funeral scene in the first season. And, even though it'd just reinforce my argument, I can no longer hear the techno-guru Man With No Name anymore without picturing Tony Soprano in a strip club, popping Prozac, and reading ""Elder Care"", absolutely hilarious!The show is incredible, but listeners may be better served buying the ""Mob Hits"" collection. As for this CD, fuhhhgedabowdit."
2,"This book is not really about taking photographs. It is more about understanding how light behaves and how it relates to the photographic process. Not just a book about studio lighting & flashes, it applies to every shot you take. Going way beyond simply throwing tons of light on a subject to get the right exposure, the techniques and concepts explained enable the photographer to understand and to control the aspects of their lighting sources. Once you wrap your head around the ideas, it becomes relatively simple to figure out the correct arrangements to achieve your desired effects.You don't need to understand physics or chemistry to benefit from this book. All ideas are well explained and use real world examples.In terms of publishing, you get your money's worth. Nice binding and paper. The text and image quality is quite good. Certainly a book you will keep around and come back to over the years."
1,"Every kid interested in Star Wars and LEGOs wants this because of the cool minifigure. However, it is a 22 minute cartoon so why go to the expense of including Blu-Ray and a DVD discs when a cheaper DVD disc would be sufficient. Even at half the price, which is what you'll pay at a local mega-store (starts with a W), it isn't worth the price. So now parents have to explain to kids why it isn't worth it."
1,"Not worth buying this parts. This are Japannesse THREE FIVE brand parts in a MOOG box, and the actually cost double than the THREE FIVE, just beacause of the box they came in"
1,"The story is short and bad for an erotica thriller. There aren't enough thrills to really make it a good thriller, and there aren't enough sex to make it a good erotica either. I was hoping the story would get better as I read on, but I was wrong. What a waste of money."
2,"I used this pack for the 39.3 mile two-day Avon Walk for Breast Cancer in Washington DC. It served me exceedingly well. It's nice and small, not bulky, and very light - yet it has lots of pockets and pouches to put things. I carried a 50oz Camelbak, two cell phones, two backup batteries, an MP3 player and two speakers, extra clothing (socks, underwear, jacket), snacks, and a first aid kit with me. This pack was small enough to carry without feeling like a pack mule, and large enough to fit all that stuff which made the walk so much better.I highly recommend this as a day pack for people that are looking for something to carry around, for example in a theme park, during day hikes, etc. It was well worth the money, and has stood up to some pretty rigorous uses already."
1,Textbridge was recommended to me to solve my problems of scanning originals into a word document. This product definitely disappointed me. It did not do the job. I still ended up with a mess in the word document. DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!
1,"I ordered this phone form Cingular (ATT) and today my third defective phone came in the mail. A customer service rep told me that 85% of all her returns and exchanges come from this model phone. The first phone had a handset speaker that didn't work and the next 2 were, in the words of the customer service rep, ""DOA"" -- dead on arrival. It would be a really nice phone if it worked though..."
1,"The product looks well-made, but it did not function for me. I attempted the installs on three different PCS - one with Vista 32-bit, one with Vista 64-bit, and one with XP. In each case, the drivers were not recognized, and the cable would not work. I tried the drivers from Startech.com and then tried some generic ones from Google. Count me as another unhappy customer."
2,We first saw the video on the girls web site and loved it. Wish they would sing more songs that the one. This is worth buying.
1,This blow dryer holder is too small my sedu blow dryer coudnt fit =( i was disapointed.... if you have a blow dryer thats short and thick this wont help at all but if you have those long skinny blow dryers than this would be perfect....
2,"I began taking magnesium supplements to help ease a bout of TMJ a year ago. This is by far the best source of magnesium I have found to keep my digestive system amazingly regular, to not bloat me, and to literally calm my nerves."
2,a great book for father's day a. Any outdoors person concerned with nature and balance will love this book.
2,the book arrived before the scheduled date in pristine condition and I couldn't have been happier.
1,"Love Tom Hanks, but I nodded out a few times, I could not finish the movie and after watching the trailer wanted to like it but was extremely disappointed."
2,Love these watches! I now have three different colors. The battery change is kind of a pain to find someone that can do it right and not screw up the seal and it runs about $40. But the watches are tough and of solid build. The customer service is off the hook at Momentum! These are the only sports watches that I have purchased for the past 10 yrs.
2,"In a series of little scenes, Dai Sijie presents you with jigsaw puzzle-like pieces that suddenly, in the final chapters, merge into a great picture. Western readers used to a more linear plotline might fumble during the first few chapters, but just let the scenes wash over you and you will find yourself carried to a clever, ironic and satisfying ending. Anyone with an ounce of Chinese history under their belt will appreciate this wry look at China's cultural revolution in action. A quick read - well worth the short investment of time."
2,"I have to believe that the negative reviews on this product are due to operator error. My used sleek showed up w/1600 songs on it. I plugged it into my laptop which recognized it immediatly. I deleted most of the songs(sorry brittney and J-Lo) and loaded my library (you know,with good music).I could not be happier. Good battery life."
1,"I enjoyed Anna Maxted's previous novels and bought this one in hopes that it would follow in that vein. I read through the first chapter or so at the book store and thought it would be a wonderful book. However, my view abruptly changed when the main character was raped. From the perspective of a rape survivor this book was horrid. The incident came about with no warning and severely triggered me. I would have appreciated a slight warning (calling Stuart a ""rapist"" or a ""criminal"" on the book description instead of a ""cad"" would have sufficed), so that way I could have either prepared myself for what was coming or avoided the book altogether. I urge anyone who recommends this book to a friend to remember that what is light-hearted and strong to you, may not be considered as such to someone who has survived a rape (more likely it will be considred being forced to relive a traumatic event)."
2,"Similar to Voltaire's ""Candide"", this book examines the exploits of the Spinozan Jacques, and his adventures in a world he considers predetermined. The book is a cunning statement on the absurdity of human affairs, and mocks the value of metaphysical thought."
2,"Love the interplay between the characters as well as the actors versatility to play these complex roles. Great storylines, lots of action but little gore, and tons of lessons on true friendship."
1,"I bought a new iphone4 and needed a new bluetooth headset as my older Motorola, which worked perfectly with my Nokia phone, did not work at all with my new one. I looked at the reviews and bought the Plantronics headset that had all the latest features, but was about half the price of the very newest model. Needless to say, it was a complete waste of money. I spent over 6 hours with Apple tech support going through all configurations of their software, firmware, and even paying $30 for a hardware replacement just to isolate that it was this headset that was incompatible. It's too late to return this one, the money I spent getting an iphone replacement, and the money I will have to spend to get a high end bluetooth headset that will work (about $160) start to add up. Bottom line: don't waste your money."
1,This DVD and the two companion DVD's were a complete rip off. $14.95 each and they were only ten minutes each!! No where did I see that in the description of them. The ten minutes each was a very superficial description of the Hermitage. I am returning these expecting a full refund.For anyone considering these DVD's my suggestion is to find some other source for your information about St. Petersburg and the Hermitage. Nick Gotten
2,"This concert marked the high point of big band jazz. The best musicians of the period, Harry James, Lionel Hampton, Gene Krupa, Benny, and many more went all out for this event.This recording captures all of the vibrations of that evening. It has the applause segments, some commentary by Benny himself, recorded some years later, the full range of each instrument and a real sense of being there.The price of all this is that some snaps and crackles from the original are not filtered out. The virtuosity of each musician comes through!"
1,This book is terrible. There is nothing in this book that you can't find with a little searching on the internet.
1,"This book seems to be very similar to the Dale Carnegie's best seller, How to make friends and influence people. Nothing wrong with it, that book has a public and is very well received in the world of sales people.Now, as a spiritual book, it is quite far from anything with a real depth. For people who like the ""How to"" books, trying to get a shortcut to enlightenment, it is okay but for people with a little level of maturity, it will be disappointing."
1,"This a very badly written book about a fascinating woman. The author's sources are not very thorough and he uses a lot of blanket statements. I was shocked by his condescending manner of the cultures with ""the Tartar population in gaudy oriental dress"" (267) and ""the gaudy St. Basil Cathedral.""(103n) He was completely patronizing and elitist in his view of Russian history and in particular the peasant and working class. He seems more interested in the frivolous details (the horror! they couldn't find Alexandra's hairdresser!)and fancy balls then real history."
1,"Howard Stern always says if you wanna be rich you gotta start your own religion, thats exactly what the author, Rael, is trying to do here.The only truth about this book is that it is obviously the work of Satan through his demons who are actually aliens from outter space. The book actually tries to get the reader to look up into space and try to make telepathic contact with the ""alien creators"". (page 184) Its all BS and is an attempt to discredit the true creator of the universe.Satan knows he has little time before he is finished and is trying to do all he can to take as many people with him to hell, this is one more attempt at trying to trick people. DON'T FALL FOR IT."
2,"Along with another reviewer, this is my first Susan Carroll novel and I'm hooked. I won't launch into the contents of the book because plenty of people have given you summaries. The writing flowed well with likeable, yet flawed characters, and an interesting plot line. May be a bit fluffy, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with that, I thought that made it more enjoyable. Because a book has romance and sex in it doesn't make it not worth reading."
2,"This is a decent CD. I bought it for ""Spell"". Harvey Jason's best work I think has been with other artists. But if you are a real Harvey Mason fan. This CD is definitely worth buying!"
2,I really enjoyed the above book and thought well enough of it to buy two more of them. Great service!
2,"I had the great pleasure of spending some time with Johnnie Lee and her dear friend Asia about 20 years ago. She told me she was a singer, but I never had the opportunity to hear her perform --- until now!! All I can say is WOW! I'm truly proud of her. This disc is nothing short of sensational. Rock, blues, jazz --- Johnnie Lee has all the bases covered, and with an incredible variety of texture and tone. There is real passion in every song, and some of these melodies had to have been very difficult to master. I'm so happy to have found, quite by accident, this incredible CD. I hope she reads this review, because I was so taken with her way back then that I wrote a character based on her into my novel, coincidentally published around the same time that this CD was issued. The link is below:Confluence: A NovelJohnnie, I hope you are well and happy and prosperous. This disc deserved to be a big hit. If you have any interest in contacting me, write to: flowerhillbooks@verizon.net"
1,Poe is my favrite band. I like all the talking in the song. It os very cool. The talking sounds neat. It is better than music becus i like listening 2 talking
2,"This book is a must read for all who want to understand why Europe:1. is failing in it's attempts to deal with muslim immigrants2. why muslims are not being integrated into european society3. why at the current birth rates, the european muslim population will become the majority in the near future and Europe will become Eurabia.This book should be compulsory reading for all Americans and especially our politicians. The Caged Virgin, by Hirsi Ali, continues this discussion focusing on the plight of muslim women and also offering suggestions to Western governments for dealing with muslims."
2,This book is a quick read and packed with creative ideas for the homeowner and interior design students. It is not an indepth study of lighting but more of a useful handbook. The organization of the information by room brings the reader right to the point without a lot of information clutter.I would also recommend this book to computer graphic artists who want the basics of residential lighting for their projects.- jim
2,"If you're looking for more serious information and training for SAR dogs these is a GREAT book. It's clear, well written with serious information on what a SAR dog AND handler must be like. It takes you from step 1 (choosing a puppy) to having a full operational SAR dog (radio communication, handler's, training step by step, etc).So, why 4 stars and not 5? This book isn't very open to different techniques, methods, dogs or info from around the world. For wood search it's very good. If you want info on avalanche or disaster search it's not very complete."
1,"I was in shock as I was reading the rave reviews for this novel. I can't believe anyone enjoyed this book even half as much as Coupland's other novels. I've read all his books, fiction and non-fiction, and this is by far the least Coupland-esque book I've ever read. It was mundane and typical. I'll admit, I couldn't even bring myself to finish it. And, that's saying something. I have to finish books. It's the OCD in me. I hate an unfinished book. But, this was just painful. I couldn't do it. Even the writing was different. I can appreciate the novel, even the worst books I can appreciate, but it is definitely the worst of Coupland's amazing collection."
1,"I have to say... all the CGI movies I have watched have all been top-notch as far as story goes. I'm talking about Toy Story I & II. Finding Nemo. Shrek. etc. etc. I realize this wasn't made by the same company as Toy Story and Nemo... but it IS from the creators of Shrek. Therefore this movie fails. The animation is good, yes. But the jokes are empty. Nothing is really funny at all. The story is almost non-existant and had no real direction.In my opinion, this movie was a waste of space. In everyway possible. Shame on you, Dreamworks. Shame on you."
2,"My son adores this CD. We play it Saturday and Sunday mornings, and he sits and listens to it all the way through, every time. His face lights up when it starts...don't expect this the first time; my son's come to know it from its opening fanfare, and your child ultimately will too."
1,"shallow, sophomoric. the story was good, but choppily told and the sex was like sugar-water on steak: didn't belong, had no purpose, tasted wierd. the acusations that this is a money grab after the events of sept 11 are definitely misguided, this book was well in the works long before and was on bookshelves that week. it's too bad that it is less of a tribute to firefighters (as it claims to be) and more of a tribute to shallow relationships. overall it seems like it was a short story that got dragged out, stretched and padded."
1,"I found this book to be loaded with information. The author did an especially good job of incorporating the political, economic, and social context into the discussion of period styles. My main complaint about this book, however, was the complex writing style. It seemed to jump around a lot in attempt to include a basic overview of everything. This became VERY confusing at times. I feel it would be most helpful to someone who already has a solid background in the history of interior/furniture design periods. There was a lot of information about specific arts and crafts of each period (ie. metalwork, ceramics, woodwork)."
2,"I love this product. I don't think that it works as well as Cauladlie's Whitening Serum, but it's a cheaper way to keeep my ivory color going after using a dose of the more expensive brand. This lasts forever! I will definitely keep alternating with my Caudalie. Perfect product!"
1,"Pros:-Absorbs sweat-Dries *kinda* fastCons:-Gets ruined easily; backpack straps, anything velcro, they will tear at the material and ruin it REALLY quickly.-Though it absorbs sweat, that sweat SHOWS-Doesn't look good. Definitely not a shirt you can wear out. (IMHO)Definitely wouldn't buy a shirt with this material again."
1,"I used the Blue Spectrum Light Therapy Device during the times I was living in a cave in France. I thought it would help nourish my skin and provide my eyes with much needed Light sensation but all I got was a horrible headache and pain in my eyes. For days I couldn't see very well and had to sleep it off.Also, some of the food (I was eating hermit crabs) I ate reacted vigorously against the Blue Spectrum Light which caused me to get huge patches of rashes."
2,This is the sound you're looking for when getting into the 70s mood. The album is especially good because it's not a standard off the rack 70s sampler. The whole is larger than the sum of the parts!
2,Do not consider Sidekicks a poor mans Karate Kid. It is a unique movie that is great for the whole family. A few mild vulgarities/ nothing worse than what your first grader would hear on the bus on his/her way to school. Chuck Norris plays a compelling role here and the kid is pretty good too. Don't look for this title on DVD by the way- was only released on VHS.
1,I was totally confused by it. I thought the lead character Hierro was a baby and an idiot. It sucked period not at all like the other novellas I have seen. I really wish I didn't have to rate this crap. Worst I have ever seen.
1,"You know you're in trouble when they can't afford horses and the actors have to pull the carts!As much as I like Eric Roberts, this movie sucked. It was boring, the dialog was stilted, the fight coreography sloppy, and there was very little of Eric Roberts in it. He's a fine actor, but he just couldn't carry this movie by himself and nobody else was helping.You can watch this as a family movie, but it would probably bore the kids to death.If it were possible to give a film no stars, this would be it! So save your money, and if you want to buy a really good Eric Roberts film, I suggest Nature of the Beast, with Lance Heinricksen (one of Eric's best bad guy rolls!)or Race Against Time (he actually plays the good guy in this one!)."
1,"Getting lost in Manchester, England several times in one day - weasked people for help showing our ""new"" map and were told it wasout of date. Got some laughs at some places. We were very disappointed."
2,"The Sufi Book of Life 99 Pathways of the Heart for the Modern Dervish, by Saadi Shakur Christi, is an enriching experience beginning with the Names of Allah in Arabic and expanding the translation to a myriad of interpretations and inspirational lights. There is so much to find about yourself within the pages of this mystical book that opens up the Quran to anyone who is fortunate and receives this inspiration. The chapters begin with a name of God, and open up other meanings to ponder, bringing the seeker into a deeper reflecion and meaningful insight about ordinary experience. Somehow the concept of an oracle holds true with this book if you are led to it or gifted with this, as it is based on the names of God. I already like if not love this book, and I have only had it for a couple of days."
2,"On appearance I give this watch 5 stars. My only complaint is that the ticking sound is very pronounced. It seems that most of the noise is transmitted through the back so, if you wear it fairly snug like I do, it's almost silent. If you wear it loose like a bracelet, it could drive you crazy. The band is incredibly comfortable and easy to adjust and use."
2,"I have a 9-year-old 65 pound dog (mixed breed). Over the last year he has slowed down, and more recently could not even jump onto the bed or into my truck. A buddy of mine recommended these, so I gave it a shot. It took a couple of weeks, but what a difference it has made. He is like a puppy again. Lots of energy. He easily jumps onto the bed, runs around the yard, and is much more playful.For my dog, he really likes the flavor, even more than his treats. I started him off with three a day, but have gone down to two a day now that he has shown huge improvement. This is what the directions recommended and I have seen no regression. This product (currently around $46) is well worth the money."
2,"Ok, so I'm sentimental. I prefer Holiday Inn over White Christmas, I never get tired of ""It's a Wonderful Life"", and I was a young 'un who watched the Bing Christmas TV special where he performed with David Bowie.This album is what my memories are made of. you can listen to your local clear channel radio station, which started playing Christmas tunes after Labor Day, I tried, i couldn't name most ofthe artists, and honestly, ""Don't they know it's Christmas? "" Yeah, that gets me in the spirit.Simple, timeless renditions of simple timeless music. It will be playingin the background over Christmas Eve, invoking new memories."
2,"""The Great Blues Sea"" has become one of my favourites. Soultouching blueswith deepgoing lyrics, telling of life experience and of this better world,we pagans (and many others!) are working and living for. Goes right underthe skin!Morgaine (Spain)"
2,"People I have to say something. everyone says that madison is black, but I think she is italian. She has an olive complexion, like me and I'm Italian. This was an awesome toy."
2,"This book was given to me by a friend. He read the book in a single sitting. Impressive, considering it's 193 pages. I picked it up and began reading. I began reading the most powerful book I've read in over a decade.It's the type of book you know is inspired by a higher power. Fr O Malley definately has a flow to his writing and it that keeps you wanting more. Twice I was moved to tears, tears of sadness and joy, for life, love, for God.Although good, this book is not for everybody. It's for someone who is searching for God. It is for someone with a desire to do Gods will above all else.In the end Fr. O Malley dies of cancer and one instinctively understands that this is his way of the cross, sadness mixed with understanding that the way of the cross is never easy.I highly recommend it."
2,"THANKFUL, Is the best debut CD I have heard in a very long time. The songs are so great and penned perfectly to match her styles and wonderful voice. Every Song Kelly touches is Gold. This ablum is amazing. One thing that I really liked was the fact that she spread her CD into different musical types... There is some RnB, Great ballads, and she even has some that boarder line on pop-rock. Kelly is a true music artist and has an imense amount of talent. Another song that deserves credit is Timeless (found on runner-up Justin Guarini's CD). Timeless is the only song that sands out on Justins CD its because Kelly sings every song with the same amount of soul, and passion, as when she was on American Idol trying to win the US public. This album should be a standard for other artists to try to beat!!This album is now Grammy nomminated and Kelly stands a great chance of winning. Go Kelly !!"
1,Too much speculation and dramatic detail of conjectured events. The Escott book is MUCH better.
2,"This a cool movie about a vampire who sucks peoples blood and kills them. There's a old guy named Van Helsing who tries to kill Dracula. I think everyone has seen this, which is good, beacuse it's a great film. You should go but it."
1,"The American war of independance through red, white and blue tinted glasses. I recommend you don't see this movie. If you like romanticised Hollywood history lessons, see ""Revolution"" with Al Pacino. Much better film, much better story. ""The Patriot"" truly is patronising and should rightly insult your intelligence. Mel Gibson has actually been in a couple of decent films, but this is utterly rancid cheese."
2,"I bought it last week, been using it everyday for 30 minutes a day and it's functional. Don't have any issues with it. It's the perfect tool for the lazy man that I am. I don't enjoy running nor do I like going to the gym as I feel that's a waste of time and $ and this is a good substitute tool to use to fulfill my cardio needs"
1,I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY CHILDREN AGES 10 AND 11. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE LIKE THE ARCADE GAME THAT YOU DANCE TO THE BEAT. I WAS SO WRONG THE KIDS TRIED IT A COUPLE OF TIME. THEY SAID IT WAS NO FUN IT WAS IN THE GARAGE SELL THAT SUMMER
2,"Im big Schumacher fan and this season was so great for Ferrari. They made all records!! Picture is good, commentary is nice. What I only marking litle minus is digital 5.1 sound missing."
2,This is a great Christmas CD for someone who enjoys traditional christmas music!!! A great combination of singing and orchestra movements. Gotta love it...
1,"I tried very hard to like this book, but I did not. It is depressing, dark and sad. Wildly powerful ? Consistently brillant ? Not even close. What could possibly be uplifting about living out of a damn grocery cart, fighting off the ""unwashed"" dregs of the street. And in the end, the poor smuck ""The Man"" dies- leaving the poor ""boy"" an orphan!I read a book to be entertained, learn from history, a biography, and ultimately be uplifted. I don't need a book (and no one else should) that makes me want to slit my wrist - or maybe build a bomb shelter ! Be forwarned."
1,"The aerolatte worked fine the first two times, and then just stopped. Changed the batteries a few times thinking that was it, but no. I have no idea why it's suddenly a non-functioner but I'm not rushing out to buy another one."
1,"I got this game so that my toddler would have something to play on my Playstation. When he first received the game, he loved it (about a week); however, when he learned there were only 7 screens for play, he got bored (3 worlds with 2 adventures plus one that you go in each time you complete a journey). And, changing the levels (easy - hard) only changes the amount of numbers you must find but not the adventures. The only time he pulls it out (once a month, if that) is when I am not available to help him with another game. I feel I wasted my money. And, as another reviewer mentioned, it seems to use the same numbers over and over."
2,"This was my favorite book when I was young. I still think of it everytime I see a rainbow in the sky. I highly recommend it for your kids. It has great drawings, a good story and lots of animals for the kids to look at."
2,"Wedding Goddess is a soulful look at the sacred ritual of marriage. Laurie Sue Brockway brings you into the world of weddings in the most beautiful, altruistic sense rather than how the machine of the wedding industry commercializes it. Laurie Sue is a minister who customizes weddings to the individual--there's no pat formula here, just two people in love coming together in the way that makes them feel most connected. This book is for those who are getting married but also for everyone who wants to open your heart and honor the committment to yourself and humanity."
2,I received this through the Amazon vine program. These labels are heavy grade of paper that will completly cover any errors that you might have made on a previous label as long as this label size is the same as your original label. The package contains a link to a format you can use with Word that allows you to print labels that conform to the sheets you have.I have a Kodak ink printer and I had absolutely no problems feeding the sheets through it. I was able to refeed the sheets easily if I did not use all of the labels the first time.The adhesive on the labels holds well and I have had no problem.I would highly recommend these labels for normal and for corrective labeling.
2,"(I've read ""The Shell Collector"" twice, treasuring it even more the second time.) When I saw recently that there were more books by Anthony Doerr, I ordered them all.) I have just finished reading ""About Grace"", and I loved it! The attention to detail is wonderful. The heartfelt emotion is amazing. The story itself is amazing. I highly recommend this book and this author! I look forward to reading and rereading his books again and again. And I don't ordinarily reread books."
2,"I just finished reading this book, and I am glad I bought it!If you are looking for an indepth book on psychicism, this is NOT the one. However, if you are just starting to investigate/read on the subject, then this book is a great place to start. It covers so many related subject headings and gives a taste of each, just enough for you to decide whether you'd like to research a specific subject further or not.The book is certainly thought-provoking and it could actually help guide your next readings on the subject."
1,"""The Egyptian Origin of Christianity"" is incoherent. It's perfectly clear that an editor's pencil never touched a page of this self-published manuscript. It's equally clear the author is incapable of writing either transitional sentences or paragraphs. It would be more than generous to suggest this 'book' was a first draft; however it tracks more like a stack of note cards dropped on the floor and then recovered by a very diligent typist. I am disgusted that Amazon would participate in a business relationship with a vanity house without warning its customers that they might well be ordering incoherent trash."
2,"I used these things all the time while in China for a few months and when I got home, I realized how convenient they are. This thing boils a full 1.5 litres an shuts off in 6 minutes by my timing. I haven't had any problems with it so far, and use it for more than I originally planned. When I'm pressed for time I preboil cold water and tranfer to stovetop to speed up water for pasta, potatoes and it is convenient for household cleaning. It is attractive, simple and easy to clean. The outside does get hot, but the handle and the loop at the top are fine. The cord is a bit short, but I don't actually store mine on the counter top because it does it's job so quickly. Just what I wanted!"
2,"The songs on GH are great but i think they left out some things that make Bjork, Bjork.(Neon Lights, One Day, Cocoon, you get it)But this album is definetly worth your money."
1,"At first when I received this product for Christmas, I was very excited because I have a lot of digital photos that would be nice to display. However there were a couple major problems with this picture frame:1. The display was quite poor, but I guess that's what you get for $1002. The video and sound was pretty much useless.3. The reliability is very poor. After 3 weeks the frame started making a squeeling noise. We sent it back and then received another one that didn't even turn on. I sent that one back for a refundIt appears that there are better digital picture frames for just a little more money out there so I would pass on this one even though it isn't very expensive."
1,"Okay, first things first. The shoes have excellent comfort on the bottoms of your feet when running. The bad news, because the tongue is so short the edges where the shoelaces lace into end up cutting into your ankles (literally). I wore these shoes and about 10 minutes into my run, my ankles where bleeding. Blood red does not go well with white. I have however rectified a solution to this. You will have to pull out the plastic that holds the shoelaces in(they are blue in color). They are not needed and only cause problems. For me I had only needed to remove the outer plastic, but that might change for someone who is not flatfooted. If you don't like cutting up your shoes, don't buy these."
2,"I love this book because it is just what I need - a ""Guide"" that gives me a ""Quickstart"" coding ""Javascript"" and uses ""Visual"" aids. That might be why Peachpit calls it a ""Visual Quickstart Guide"" instead of ""The Fixated Geek's Complete Bible of Javascript""."
1,"YES! I agree with the last review. I bought this item thinking it was a polo shirt, instead I got a regular t-shirt. It is true that they call it tee, but the picture is misleading.I also had a problem with the seller, where I received the wrong size (instead of men's I got boys' sizes). So in agreement with the last reviewer, I also will not be buying from them again."
2,"The authur is a wonderful speaker and candid guru for the ""Course in Miracles"" text. The material will literally change your mind about the way we view the world. It sincerely brings about much peace of mind. I listen to this book frequently, making it a part of my daily, weekly, or monthly spiritual study.!!"
1,"Hey all -I'm not sure I get the positive reviews associated with this product. I guess it's not the worst thing I've ever bought but keep in mind a few things - FM reception seems very poor, in my area at least, compared to other radios. The buttons/switches are balky without a positive feel to them. Third, sound quality is mediocre in my opinion - granted it's a cheap plastic player, but man.... Last, if you're thinking about buying the accessory powered subwoofer (something that could potentially make a difference) - it's apparently no longer in production though it seemed to take AL customer service quite a while to figure that out. Overall, I'm not too thrilled. Probably won't pitch it in the trash, but maybe it'll go in the garage."
2,"Perry Mason (Raymond Burr) plays a bad guy. That's the only bummer in this Hitchcock mystery. James Stewart has the lead role. They don't make mysteries like this anymore. HD movie makes the difference on my 55"" screen. It creeps you out like you're right there. It will keep you on the edge of your seat. See if you can see Alfred Hitchcock in the opening few scenes. He made a cameo in all the movies he directed if you didn't know that bit of trivia."
2,"Spies should be shown the greatest respect for the work they do and all information sent by them are sacred and should not be doubted!Even if the drawings of the Secret Weapon look like that of a household appliance.'Our Man In Havana' is written with a straight ""face"". You would however be struggling to keep your face straight as you read the book. At a time when I'd just finish the Smiley trilogies and some other spy novels by John le Carre, 'Our Man In Havana' made the spy game seem highly ludicrous and easy. Completely unlike the cold, lonely, intellectually-draining world of George Smiley. However, the book is not without its dark elements, which exist in the form of an influential Captain who so happens to carry a human skin cigarette case.A light-hearted satirical comedy, 'Our Man in Havana' is delightful in prose and easy to read. The reader grows to like the doting father but George Smiley, he sure isn't. George Costanza, he just could be."
2,"I did not buy this on amazon but now that i found it on here i will certainly buy it from here. I was introduced to this miracle worker 3 years ago because i suffer from chronic migraines since i was a child. I have always had to use prescription pain killers and even had shots because sometimes pills won't do the job. I can honestly say that I NEVER leave the house without this in my purse, it has helped me time and time again to alleviate the pain of migraines. I am not saying that it has worked on its own but it has made it easier for me to get through the pain of migraines and has made it possible for me to be able to take Advil instead of prescription drugs. I put it on my temples, behind my ears, in the back of my neck and on my forehead as soon as i start getting the migraine and depending on how i feel i apply it every hour until the pain disappears. I strongly recommend it for anyone who gets migraines and I am sure it works great for other pains as well."
2,"This is an amazing story of one of the ""odd balls"" in life. I actually laughed and cried as I followed the heroine through her trials of dealing with being different in a mainstream world."
1,My sister has this CD. We had to listen to it in the car and I hated it. It's not even R&B! Every song on it is a slow song. It's like GET OVER IT!!!!!
1,"I must say I am disappointed. I was looking for a book for the amateur gilder, and I got a book for the gilding hobbyist. This book teaches you to gild objects around the home (i.e. picture frames, tassels, and yes--even a toilet seat), but does not go any further than that. For the purposes of gilding as a hobby, this book is complete. For the purposes of practical gilding (like sculpture, architecture, and wood work), this book is lacking, and there is nothing in the book's description or title to suggest as much. So, be warned."
1,The underlying violence and dark nature of this film loses me. I rented it for someone else. I do hate such movies.
2,The product arrived in perfect condition a day earlier than promised. They fit my Kenmore range perfectly. I couldn't be happier with this product. I haven't had them long enough to need to clean them but am unconcerned because at the price I could buy them once a month if I needed to! I was unable to get chrome for my black range from Sears. They had only black replacements which were very difficult to clean and cost $19 dollars for EACH large pan. See why I'm happy?
2,"I've bought this book 4 times. Each time someone comes over they end up taking it with them! I was born in Cuba and can make almost anything from sushi to apple tartin, but I can't make the Cuban food my mother makes... this book gets me there. It doesn't replace Mom's cooking, but boy does it come close! This is the best investment."
2,"Spellbinder was the 1st Night World book I have ever read.I recomended this book to ALL my friends,and I recomend it to you also. L.J. Smith is a very talented writer and I plan to read ALL of her books to come."
2,The movie was enjoy able and cinimaticthe story line was good. Some of it was funny but weirdI would recomend this to johnny Depp fans and vampire fans
1,returned this item because: although the earbuds produced enough bass it was at the expense of clear highs. bought a ten dollar pair of phillips @ a drug store that were much better sounding.
1,"Visited Tokyo not once I can say there is no Tokyo in movie.There is city,any city but not Tokyo.Movie do not nave any plotand concenrate on some soft-core porn.So,why bother call itx erotica?Who knows."
1,"This movie started off really well. The introduction was solid. However, the movie fell apart along the way when you couldn't find the storyline. And you didn't share an interest in the two lovers. One character was remotely interesting and he was pretty good. The african american actor who was very good in the film. I admire the filmmakers enthusiasm and they did some very nice shots and setps but as a whole, it was empty and you didn't care or even remember the characters. And for the film ""to be continued"" was a little pretentious of them, assuming they would have a hit and garnered interest for a second film. Good shot, guys ... in places a lot of fun but fell short in the character and plotline"
1,"You can hear from the Windows Media samples that the tracks have been filtered to death. A much more vibrant transcription of the same recordings is the wonderful ""King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band: The Complete Set""."
2,I'm very interested in what Superman's life might have been like prior to adulthood. This series lets you see that. It's really enjoyable.
1,"This CD is so bad, my dog rolled over and played dead and then stopped as soon as the sample was over. Who in their right mind would allow this CD to even be made? Or better yet, who was the sound man who was recording this? By far the worse track, like they're not all bad, is ""Si Volvieras A Mi"". If you couldn't speak the language well, why sing in it? If I had my way I would have asked for a star to be given to me as an accident for finding this CD."
2,Product arrived quickly and was easy to setup. Like the battery backup and digital display of carbon monoxide level so you can see if levels are changing.
1,"This is one of the worst novels I have picked up in a long time. The action scenes are cartoonish. The characters are unrealistically smart and ridiculously stupid, sometimes on the same page. The author seems to have developed his Middle East perspective in the propoganda office of Yasser Arafat. While most insulting to Jews, Mr. Land appears to be an equal opportunity insulter. Palestinians and Catholics will likewise be displeased in the way Mr. Land portrays them. Mr. Land has a childishly unrealistic view of the current political scene in the Middle East. I am sorry I wasted my time on this silly, poorly written, poorly researched work."
1,it was kinda boring and the same stuff over and over.the moves werent that hard and didnt seem like much of a work out
1,"Not exactly the most exciting SW novel. Also, bringing alive a plague that's been dead for a couple thousand years or whatever years? Barbra Hambly has been able to make me never want to visit Nam Chorios. I won't spoil the callista matter for you, but there isn't much to spoil. I only finished it because of my complete devotion to everything that has to do with star wars."
1,I paid for express shipping and it arrived 7 days later. It came broken in the package too.
2,"This is a an excellent piece of work. Ashcroft has produced a lightly layered composition that seems more like the Verve on valium, however a new complexity lies within the brooding personal lyrics of Ashcroft, who appears to be happy and in love with his wife and son throughout the disc. ""A Song For the Lovers"" should keep Verve fans happy while ""I Get My Beat"", ""Brave New World"" and ""On A Beach"" is new unexplored territory. The only song that doesn't work on the disc is ""C'mon People...."" which is laughably bad. Impressions that come to mind as I listen: deep, brooding, voice too cool for his own good and funky acoustic all add up to a great sounding disc. Ashcroft is one of the last true rock stars walking around in the new millennium and I don't think the guy is capable of producing a bad album. If you liked Urban Hymns, this new disc will seem more like an appetizer, but a great tasting one that makes you crave more of the same."
1,"I bought this book thinking that I would get a consies guide to quickly setting up and internet server for my home. However, the CD refused to boot (and would stall during ths install, I had to install off of a spare harddrive) the examples are too short to be useful, Many of the paths are written incorrectly, it is plauged with numerous errors and most of the content of the book can be found in larger Linux administration books for the same price! Needless to say, I was very disappointed indeed."
1,"""Jagged Little Pill"" is possibly my favorite CD of the 1990's so I had high expectations for this one, but it was a real let down. Almost every song on ""Pill"" jumped off the radio or CD player and demanded your attention, I can barely remember a thing about the new CD after 3 listens. I hate the intros to half the songs. Alanis does not have a ""beautiful"" voice, and she needs tough arrangements around her songs to bring out its qualities. I am really disappointed in this one. I wanted to love it."
2,We seen this group in 2005 and have been wanting to find their album ever since then. I found it and gave it to my wife as a gift and she has played it nearly every day since. This is a great group and even better live.
1,"I felt the movie had potential (especially after reading the reviews) until the director introduces Brad Pitts’ character. This overly manic character went on for too long for my taste. It was exhausting and distracting. From this point through another 30 minutes, 12 Monkeys no longer held my interest and pressed the eject button."
1,"We bought this Emer Galilieo vacuum cleaner for about $400 more than one year ago. The retractable cord broke after a short time. We had to send the vacuum to NJ to get it repaired by using the warranty. After a month they sent it back with the same problem and the on-off button was broken as well! I called the customer service and asked for refund or replacement and they were kind enough to replace the vacuum with a new one. This vacuum is very powerful, however the handle (hose) is kind of heavy and the hose twists frequently and makes it difficult to use. By considering its high price, I guess there should be much better choices than this one if you are looking for a powerful canister vacuum cleaner."
1,"This film isn't a patch on the original French film. Blanded out for U.S. audiences as usual, and Robin Williams totally miscast and allowed to run riot doing his signature schtick. Leave it alone and watch the original with the subtitles."
1,"It just goes to show that anyone can ""write a book"" nowdays. Talent, actual experience and knowledge of the subject seem to be things of the past, judging by this author's attempts.Save your money. I wish I had!"
2,"This is a fantastic product. I use it for much more than just window flashings.... anywhere a moisture barrier is needed. I also use small pieces to repair tears in building paper before the stucco is applied. My only complaint would be that it's hard to find the ripcord and pick it out of the release on the back. Once you find it and get it started, though, you're on you're way. Grace Construction Products makes a lot of good stuff, and this is one of them."
2,I like McGyver episodes and my family really enjoys the exciting episodes. Good family show.
1,I had to return it because Ultimatum was damaged. The last third of the movie was not playing properly. I returned the DVD box set on 01-04-08 and now news from Amazon yet...
1,"I agree with the last review. This dvd was so disappointing. Not only was it not of A&E; Standards, it was way offmark on the life of St. Francis. A complete waste of time."
2,Exactly as I remembered it being. Hello soufflés! I had lost mine in a move and couldn't find them 'til I checked Amazon. Thanks.
1,"I have read other novels by Kate White, but found this one very hard to read. It's not that I mind when the characters talk out problems they are faced with. Except when this occurs throughout the whole book. It didn't seem to matter what she was talking about, Bailey would run through every single question surrounding the problem. My recommendation would be to skip this novel, but read her other work."
1,"This is one of my favorite tv shows of all time, but I have never been so disappointed in any product as I was with this one. Don't bother buying the Blu-Ray version. It has been remastered in some way for high definition that results in a flat, colorless picture that is overly bright and has little detail. (I had the same problem with the new version of Upstairs-Downstairs, also by Acorn Media.) I watched about fifteen minutes of it before I gave up and got out the DVD version and watched it on my up-converting DVD player. With the DVD version, the picture is a little blurry, but at least there is color and detail, and the picture is not flat. If you already have it on DVD, leave well enough alone. If you don't have it at all don't buy the Blu-Ray version, invest in a $50 up-converting DVD player instead."
1,Typical teen movie. The only real excitement was the little nudity. But even then you can save some time and go watch something else like short bus.
1,This will work for a while and the price is low. Good temporary item.If you have any plans of using it frequently or for more than a year get an all brass one. The plastic valve handle parts will break. Mine all have.
1,"Many rave reviews of books by Mr. Heinz seem to be ""ringers"", perhaps written by the publisher or Mr. Heinz himself. How can you tell a ""ringer""? Just by clicking on the reviewers name (like ""Dave Anderson"" below) and discover that the only review he has written in seven years is for Mr. Heinz's book! Coincidence? Another favorite is to plant one from ""a reader"". Be wise, people!"
1,"Well, I am sure authors have a lot of experience in the field of DBMS. However, what they wrote is just experience, not concept or formal definition. It is extremely easy for beginners to get entangled in the lengthy and vague chatting description. For those who know something about DBMS like me, this book turns out to make them more confused. I think even the writting style needs much room to improve. My have-to course requires this textbook, but I avoided buying it. Hohoho! spending over 100 bucks on this? I don't think so. I borrowed it from my friend only for the test. If you look for a good book, try ""Database Systems Concepts"" or ""Database Systems Implementation"". They are really good, at least for me."
2,"There is a lot of potential seen in all these films, especially ""Slings and Arrows"". The director has created a glimpse into his vision of what he hopes this film could be and has done and outstanding job with all the limitations student films bring. Excellent lighting, cinematography and sound, which is rarely a consideration for student filmmakers. A lot of hard work by the entire production team, including the very talented cast, and it pays off as the gem of this collection."
2,"What is that song in the trailer ( you can download it at www.thegirlnextdoormovie.com ) it begins right after matt says ""i shoulda kissed her"" then it has a hard rock beat then and keeps when they go to the pool and they go to the party and the only lyrics are ""I incenerate"" (sp?) well PLEAE PLEASE its driving me crazy!!!"
2,"The book Bridge to Terabithia is about a kid who is in the fourth grade. He thinks he is the fastest kid in the school. Until a girl moves in next door. The girl beats him in a race. They eventually became friends and made up a place in the woods called Tarreibthea and to get in it they have to swing in on a rope. They start hanging out and become boyfriend and girlfriend. I liked this book because it shows how close you have to keep your friends near. The lesson is for every action there is an opposite but equal reaction. Meaning, in every good but bad action, it may seem good for you but hurt you in the end. To learn more about this book go to your local libary and pick up this book. You probably wont want to put it down until the end the very end."
1,"I did not think that ""The Making of Dr.Phil"" was unbiased. Most of the quotes that were used were not at all unbiased and they were used to create the body of the work. Because the (living) author w as not used as a source I believe that the only people they could get to participate were bitter or taken from public accounts. Because of the bias of the witnesses and the less than creditable sources I would not suggest this book for true Dr. Phil fans or any one else who enjoys good, unbiased, well-written, and creditable biographies- because this is not one of them."
1,My daughter is almost 3 months I didnt have a problem with these bottles until now! The nipple falls through while im feeding her and spills all over both of us! Very disappointed!
1,"I bought this because we have well water & I thought that this may be one of the reasons my hair is so dry. This stuff is awful. It smells bad & when I used the shampoo and then rinsed it out, it made my hair feel like a haystack. After using the conditioner, it didn't make it too much better feeling. When drying my hair, I did not notice any difference in my hair's texture & it certainly didn't help make it soft, shiney or manageable. I will not be buying this again."
2,If you have not bought the Ultimate Weight Solution . . . you may want to consider reading it and then purchase the cookbook. The Ultimate Weigt Solution helps you get you into the mindset needed to live a healthier lifestyle. The cookbook gives new recipes that keep the array of food choices plentiful. Each week we pull out two new recipes which keeps the mealtime full of a few surprises rather than the same old diet food.
2,This was the best book I have ever read. Finding out both mine and my husband's love lanuages has been great. Everything was easy to follow and made so much sense. It has improved our marriage a ton and I think that every couple married or not should read this book. It was wonderful!!
2,"What You Think is What You GetIt is similar to what Deepak Chopra, Wayne Dyer, etc. talk about but with a fresh new twist. I like the way the book is organized.We heard the author GEORGE LAVENIA recently and were very impressed with him. He is a testimonial to what he preaches.I wish that this recommendationm finds you having pleasant thoughts!Since What You Think is What You Get. :-)Peace...Ed of Aberdeen"
2,We bought two scooters for our 4 year old. The quality is very good. I wish I had bought more so more kids can play at one time. I had to speak with customer service once and they were very friendly and resolved our problem very fast.
1,It is almost midnight on a school night and my daughter is camping out on the floor of our bedroom... still not asleep. After complaining about a scary book her first grade teacher read to her today I checked it out online and found this haunting cover looking back at me. I know you should not judge a book by its cover but i think an exception must be made for this book. And apparently i am not alone in this thought. It may be OK for some kids but i think this book and the whole concept of someone's skin turning into stripes is just too much. Especially for little 6 year old girls who have school the next day!
2,"I caught this one a few decades late. But it still is a really good sci-fi film. Although lacking special effects and the CGI generated visual adrenaline typical of top rated sci-fi movies today, the plot and cinematography kept my attention. This is surely a movie worth watching. I am sure the book is a pretty good read also."
2,"Couldn't believe all the people putting the hurt on this movie with 1 and 2 star reviews, I don't get what they're looking for in a horror movie. I thought this movie was pretty good, had some good scares, good special effects, great ending. My wife & I were both entertained, which is all I expect of a movie. 5 stars to counter some of these 1's. 3 stars for the movie. -kd5-"
1,"As a Spike fan, I should have listened to the warnings. But I figured if Spike is in it, I want to read it.I couldn't finish it. It was just too frustrating and angering.Spike is seriously injured saving Angel's life, still lying in bed unrecovered but instead of thanking him Angel is hatefully insulting and threatening him. Not only is this insulting to Spike's character but Angel's as well.The same goes for Buffy's treatment of Spike. It makes her seem like a horrible person.I can't tell you whether it ends well because I only got halfway through. I am an extremely fast reader so normally I would just bite the bullet and finish quickly but in this case it was just raising my blood pressure too much.If you hate Spike you'll probably cheer but other than that skip this book."
1,This machine is worthless... It is very UNCOMFORTABLE and you can sit there and do 30mins with their tape and you don't feel anything. The back massager is a REAL PAIN and it hurts so much.
1,"I have not much to add from what everyone else has said. All they have to do it increase the run time between shakes to allow the cars to actually finish the race and this would be a toy that is fun to play with. The instructions tell you to shake it at least 7 times for maximum run time. That gets you the 3 laps if you are lucky. If you only shake it once or twice it will go around about 1 time. You do have to shake it pretty hard for it to work also. My 2 year old likes to play with it but only for about 3 minutes because you have to keep picking the cars up to shake them after about 3 laps. He gets bored with it and goes onto something else. That is about as long as I can stand it as well.Neat idea, bad follow through."
1,"The ramp is ok, but I was a bit surprised that only 1 ramp was delivered. The picture shows clearly how I want to use it. I believed it was a set for that price."
1,"I had this product for a whole two days before it took a dump on me!!! I also encountered the ""File system corrupted"" screen and could not get it fixed, but then again, brand new items should not NEED to be fixed or replaced. I gave this product a one-star rating for two reasons; 1.) there is no half stars and 2.) the FM tramsmitter LOOKED pretty handy (too bad I never got to use it). I would NEVER advise someone to buy this product or any other RCA item because their service and support is a joke and their products are bogus. Thank goodness for the AMAZON return policy!"
1,"This product lasted 14 months for me and had been suitable for my purposes.After 14 months, it just died.The manufacturer has a 2 year warranty and provides no address in the product information; instead it instructs the buyer to contact the ""dealer.""Amazon, from whom I bought this product, refers the buyer to the 3rd party seller who only accepts returns for 90 days. Tried ""googling"" this company's contact information and I got an address in Korea.Metronomes are electronically rather simple and this product should have lasted much longer. This may have been a defective device. However, the product gets one star because of essentially leaving me without a way to use the warranty."
2,I wanted to see this version before the recent re-make and was not disappointed. The performances are good and the deeper emotional and ethical issues make for contemplative entertainment. The remake will have to be very good to meet the standard of this earlier version.
1,"This fanny pack is much smaller than I thought it wouldbe according to the online description. I'll have to payshipping and a restock fee if I return it, so I'll keep itand hope I'll use it sometime in the future.So, I don't recommend this fanny pack if you need one withlots of room."
2,"You can't go wrong with Emmylou BUT there really aren't that many unreleased tracks to make it worth the avid fan's money and enough can't be said about how difficult it is to get the bloody CDs out without ripping the ""box"". Falling is a Deep Hole is pretty awesome, though!"
2,True to the fact this albums musicalcontent might as well be called DSOM 3but you can go so far before the wellruns dry.I gave the album time and itgrew on me the lyrics below WATERS butstill above todays BS standards.
2,"Fast shipping, no breakage - those are the important parts! Beyond that, these jars are great for putting mixes together as holiday gifts and they're also awesome for cold BIG cold drinks (especially when keeping track of water intake)."
2,This book was very challenging for such a time as this. God is truly releasing the fire of God all over the world. This book may be out of print but the fire of God is still being released.A great book to read and to be a doer and not just a reader.
2,"tony bacon is like shakespeare when it comes to guitar. Great photos, great info. The bible of telecaster!"
2,"In 10 lb. Penalty, Dick Francis continues to develop his themes of father/son relationships and the changing vagaries of life.For the die-hard fans of Mr. Francis's early books, this could be a disapointment: his tough-for-toughness-sake heroes are gone. In their stead are characters with limitations, with spoken sorrows but (thank heaven) the same unquenchable honor and good sense. Perhaps his novels change because Mr. Francis, himself, is not the person he was 40 years ago. This will please some, not others. However, it is a respectable effort with thought-out motivations expressed in the author's clean prose.I understand this may be the final Dick Francis mystery. If so, pick out a stack of your favorites and read them all again in tribute but start with this last one. It's nice to look back on the course right after you've crossed the finish line."
1,"A movie produced with an evidently short budget, special effect are poorly designed and absolutely not realistic, but what a shame.. the movie is filled of historical inaccuracies.. one of many.. as Titanic strucks the berg the engine room is reported to being flooded.. engine room is at the very poop of the ship and didn't fill until the final plunge.. and not much attention is given to the 1500 people trapped on the doomed ship.. we can't see one raising the railings and screaming trying to save himself.."
1,What a silly book. Stephanie could have had any number of funnier adventures that were also more believable.
1,"This is definitely the last book in the Kay Scarpetta series that I will ever read. It's just all too depressing, too detailed in the most gruesome way (I DON'T want to know that the internal organs of a dead body turn into a sludgy soup in the autopsy bag), and I see no point in reading something that makes me feel dirty and crawly! The new M.E.who replaced Scarpetta in Virginia is a psycopathic wacko who is out to bring her down...yeah, yeah, yeah! And so it continues.. but not for me."
1,"I have used Frontline Plus for many years, and it worked great.........until this summer. I noticed fleas on me mutt three months ago, and it got progressively worse. I even started to apply Frontline every three weeks rather than once a month, but that had zero effect. It got so bad that I went to my vet and she stated that nearly all her patients that used Frontline were experiencing the same problem. It seems that fleas have become immune to Frontline. She recommended Trifexis (you have to get a prescriptions because it also helps prevent heartworms), and within about an hour no more fleas."
2,"I was very disappointed when my package arrived. The bottle had leaked all in the box, therefore I did not receive the full bottle. It appeared the bottle cap was loosened."
2,"This is a great sandal. I bought a pair and they are still in service half a year or more. Although you do not want to get them wet, they are great even without socks. As far as I know everything on this sandal is leather except the the bottom sole. They fit smaller than true size. I bought this 7.5 and have to bring it to the last size hole because I do have a wide foot. I bought 7.5 wide, so they run small. I had previously bought 8.5 on sale and it fit better at first. After getting them wet they will stretch. Overall this sandal has no bod points and I will buy over and over until they don't make them anymore."
2,"I am thinking of purchasing this item, and have read the reviews, however, they do not specify whether baby can sit in this tub, until now they seem to say this tub is only used lying down, please if anyone knows if this tub is ok to use sitting down inside the big bathtub please advise.Thanks"
2,"What do you get when Sage Francis goes political? The biggest threat to the Bush Administration since John Kerry. I have this on pre-order and it hasn't arrived yet, but I listened to it digitally. The whole cd is amazing. I think it might be even better than Personal Journals, but the two albums are very different so it is hard to say. Bottom line: It's only twelve bucks, man. Drop it in your shopping cart and get it now."
2,"These are great balls for playing with dogs and they last a really long time. Unlike the hard plasticky balls, these are rubber and when deflated, they are easy for the dog to pick up and also for the human to grasp it even when covered in slobber. I recommend the #4 size for medium size dogs 25-50 lbs. I can't find any other balls that come close for dog soccer. As for humans playing soccer with it, I'm not going to be much help."
1,"Another rehash of the ""priest-who-finds-document-which-will-change-the world"" theme. Some of it was interesting, but the ending when an unearthed document has Christ speaking the most politically correct utterances ever...well, it was too much! Can someone write something original about ""unearthed documents""?"
2,"The dvd plays just fine on my non HD, non BluRay Region 1 combo dvd/vhs player. When the disc is inserted, a yellowish screen appears with a line of information/numbering highlighted. Press play and the show begins. Region 1 viewers with regular dvd players need not worry, the disc does play without the need for a region free dvd player.I had high hopes for Le Petomane and I was not disappointed. Leonard Rossiter's performance was masterfully droll and the depiction of the period rang true. Loved the Queen Victoria bit. So glad that Insomniac Pictures has made this available to US viewers."
1,"Why write a book about D3D RM. It's dead, Microsoft dropped it. Makes this book a big pass."
1,"All anyone ever needs to do to know what this movie is like, watch the episode of South Park called ""The China Probrem"" (episode number 175).To sum it up. ""He was raped!""Poor Indiana Jones. We will never be able to look at him the same!"
1,Just not my cup of tea. I prefer the old standards. Thank you for following up with me and bringing it to my attention.
1,Interesting if you are alive in 100 AD. No place in modern times. Please buy and distribute to your children if you do not want them to understand science in any way.
2,"I am an old Rush fan so I must be real. It does not matter how good a new Rush CD is, as long as it does not resemble anything before Signals I will naturally be disappointed in that respect. But I have to stop letting that particular disappointment get in the way of enjoying current Rush music. So I will and did. This CD has to be the best since Signals just on the instumentals alone. Once one gets beyond Geddy's overdubbing of vocals, the music really is fresh and inspiring. We Hold On is a darn good tune and very worthy or radio play. Working them Angels and Spindrift are highlights. As an old Rush fan, I have to at least be satisfied that Snakes and Arrows is the best since Signals and makes me forget of the bad Test for Echo."
1,"I loved these pillows when I first received them, but as time passes, they are loosing feathers left and right."
1,"This is a really cheesy product. The retractable cord is really tight to plug into the iphone. The AC outlet adapter does not charge the phone. 1 out of the three piece work, which is the cigarette adapter, but it was secure loosely in the cigarette port."
2,"I like every thing about my TiVo----except---- It is so busy running around the networks finding things to record. some thimes i want to record the end of a movie or program i'm watching and i have to go into the programing an stop it from recording it has found, before i can record what I want."
1,This product is not the revere ware it was purchased to replace.It's light weight bends easily and is just not of good quality.Don't buy for the brand name as it's not what it used to be.
1,"I had purchased ""America-By-Air"" - Vol #3 when it first was offered on VHS. I was unable to find the first 2 volumes. This was pre-internet. (1983) Jump ahead 25 years and; lo & behold, Amazon had a vendor offering the complete 3-volume set (Used) for sale. I ordered same. When the set arrived and attempted to play -- the tapes would NOT track properly; skipped through tracks; sound track would be garbled or not play at all. I contacted the vendor and relayed the problems I was experiencing. The vendor stated he had bought the set from a ""GOODWILL Industries "" outlet. Sorry 'bout that!!!I located the original producer of the series and he was willing to transfer the Master Tapes onto DVDs. And included all the original inserts.Cost me approximately $65, but worth every cent."
2,"It's been two years that I waited celly cel album, having no news from him since he did not appeared on the latest sick wid it releases, so I wa quiet disspointed before listening this album but now I can tell U one thing : this album is dope too. All the songs have a bay area flava, celly cel keeps his orginal flow and there are less guets than in the g filez and that's better. few guests are Dub C, kurupt and young bleed and all did their jobs. THis album reminds me ""killa kali"" but with a more introspective and serious celly. That's the G filez best album."
1,"I READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING PRODUCT, I STILL BOUGHT IT ANYWAY... I READ THE DIRECTIONS TO A TEE AND IT STILL TOOK ME ABOUT 1.5 HOURS TO PUT TOGETHER. MY THUMBS HURT SO SO BAD. I CUT MY FINGER AND BENT A NAIL BACKWARDS GETTING THIS TOGETHER. THEN WHEN IT WAS FULLY TOGETHER I WAS MISSING A WHEEL!!! I WOULD RATHER HAD PLASTIC DRAWERS FROM WALMART THEN THIS... GOOD LUCK!"
1,Nothing much to justify this Sinatra release. The addition of one track is insufficient to have re-released this compilation.
2,"I have no idea whatsoever how I heard about this band, but I'm SO glad I did. I am officially in love with frontman, Davey Ingersoll. Yes, yes..ugly by today's silicon-standards..but I completely fell for his voice. Incredibly perfect in 'The Twisting'. Lyrics are awesome too.. think Track 10!Highlights: Estrogen Oxygen (boring in middle, though)// California//KREATES A PRESENCE TO BLUSH//THE TWISTING//mai//ANTHEMA//ROCK N ROLL AND THE TEENAGE DESPERATION"
1,"I purchased this product for my dad, who was injured and unable to play at the computer. I looked at several options and thought I picked the best option, others complained about backlight, and losing the pegs so I thought I had made a good choice. The game was horrible, the buttons un responsive, the programming ancient and slow. I returned it without ever giving it as a gift. I am pretty good at figuring out games etc, I was ready to throw it against a wall I can't imagine how my dad would have done with it!!!!Amazon was great in the return process the game was horrible"
2,"I recently bought this DVD and found that the 20-minute intervals were great for those who are strapped for time. The workout really gets your heart rate up and your blood pumping, and the routine is challenging and fun. It took me a couple of times to really get the legwork right, but once I did I was having a great time. The DVD also makes it easier to skip from one workout to the other or to the cool down stretch at the end. If you find yourself with little time to workout, then this is definitely a great investment!"
2,"This DVD is fantastic. I have been a fan of Lee Ritenour for many years and this is a treasured addition to my DVD collection. The musicians on here are top notch including Anthony Jackson, Dave Grusin, Harvey Mason, Ivan Lins, and Ernie Watts amongst others. The tracks with Ivan Lins are terrific including one called Dinorah, Dinorah which I had not heard before. Lee also plays some upbeat numbers with Eric Marienthal on sax, Melvin Davis on electric bass, and the amazing Oscar Seaton on drums. There is also a clip on here of Fourplay live when Lee was still in that group.The video quality is amazing, but I am not sure why this is presented in a Matte 4:3 aspect. Audio is an excellent stereo mix or 5.1. There are interview segments between most of the songs which is somewhat disruptive, but this does not appear to be all shot on the same day anyhow.The only thing lacking on this set is Phil Perry on vocals. That would have made this great DVD even better."
1,"AFTER ONLY TWO MONTHS, MY HUSBANDS WEDDING BAND LOOKS VERY DULL. ALMOST GREEN. THERE IS NO SHINE WHATSOEVER AND IT LOOKS LIKE A CHEAP PIECE OF METAL. I AM SO EMBARRASSED THAT I GAVE IT TO MY HUSBAND ON OUR WEDDING DAY WHICH WAS SO BEAUTIFUL. I WILL HAVE TO HAVE IT RE PLATED OR SOMETHING, BECAUSE IT LOOKS UGLY. SO MY ADVISE IS SPEND A BIT MORE MONEY IF YOU WANT THAT ""GOLD"" LOOK TO REMAIN BEAUTIFUL AND SHINY LIKE NEW."
1,"Looking at the images in this book is akin to watching a bad magician at work: the secret ""moves"" are anything but. Some of the effects like fire and smoke are obviously fake. Others, like casting shadows from blinds and plants are less so, but still ""feel"" wrong in the way the shadows often have the wrong density and falloff, or fail to follow the curves and shapes of foreground objects.If you're serious about your photography, I'd advise getting a good book on lighting by someone like Barrister, and learn to light for real. Many of the ""effects"" presented in the book can be done in seconds with some rudimentary equipment and a little practice.... or you can spend hours in PS ""perfecting"" an image that, like the magician's tricks, fools no one but himself."
1,"The Rock is a great deal better in person than in print. Perhaps this should have been a book on tape. Even still, the Rock at only 27 years old doesn't have a great deal to tell. Even though he's a 3rd generation star, and possibly the biggest star in the biz, there are no real tales of suffering in the wrestling business and getting screwed over like Mick Foley's book. It's a nice souvenir to have but the book is basically a white wash with the Rock often in character and little to no inside information or stories."
2,"I played this CD at a Bridal Shower and brought it with me to my hair salon...everyone wanted to know who the group was...they loved it. This CD is excellent!!! It is one of the best ""new age"" groups I have listened to. The mix of various music styles is smooth and very relaxing. The various sounds that are combined with the music is superb. I love to listen to this after a stressful day or even while studying. I purchased ""The Reality of a Dreamer"" by MYTHOS also, and it is excellent also. I can't wait to hear more CD's by this group."
2,"but I enjoyed it. The sex did get repetitive and I did want to read more action and [...] kicking, but I am completely addicted to this series and cannot give it low scores. I just wish that the repetitive sex with whoever is near when the ardeur strikes would cease. I started reading this series because of the amazing characters and the way Laurell Hamilton makes your mind believe they are real, not for the sex. It is a bonus, but not what the entire book should be about.Also, please give us more Jean-Claude!"
2,"It's just like a Microplane(tm): a kitchen version of a wood-rasp. It just plane (pardon the pun) works. But I take issue with the construction. They cut a corner by making the handle hollow. I appreciate the attempt to make the handle larger and more ergonomic, but it should have been solid. The hollowness throws off the balance and feels cheap in the hand. So, aside from feeling like a cheap toy, it zests and grates with the best of them."
1,"I am grateful that this book is not very heavy, as I found myself carrying it around in my backpack all day yesterday. Other than that, I'm not exactly thrilled with this book. The recipes are indeed oversimplified and generally vague, and leave my wife (who grew up in a Filipino household) and I muttering, ""Wait, that can't be right...."""
2,"I am a huge fan of Stephen Elliott's fiction; HAPPY BABY was one of the best novels of 2004. So I was excited to read this and I wasn't disappointed. It's a superb and hilarious account of Elliott's year on the campaign trail, and you don't have to be a politics junkie (I'm certainly not) to find it absolutely charming as well as remarkably insightful and smart about various aspects of American political culture. It's a classic!"
1,"Okay, when I first picked up Twisted Christmas several years ago as a kid, it was great. The little kid singing about Santa Claus being stuck in the chimney, and the christmas song about deadhead were the kind of humor that best appeals to kids.Now, however, Mister Rivers has lost it. I regret wasting the money on Twisted Tunes #2. If you want comedy/music combos, go with Weird Al or Doctor Demento collections."
1,"I thought this clock was so cute and loved the price. After only a few weeks of having it, the volume knob just broke off. That knob is also the on/off knob. So now I just use it for the clock, which changes it's own time whenever it pleases. I heard of a ton of people with the same knob problem."
1,"Hero--tortured, yes. Beast, No--and for that, I was very disappointed. I guess ""beast"" was what the townspeople thought of this unknown, unseen ""dragon"". The heroine was quite spunky--that I liked; however, I never quite understood why she was the only one who could read or who had any semblance of intelligence in that town. This story was not what I would call a beauty and the beast type tale, although the reader is lead to think it is throughout most of the book. Shame, shame!!! Romantic interludes between the heroine and the hero happen very near the end of the book, and you MUST use your own imagination--nothing explicit here. What should have been a dramatic coupling for them was a real let down for me. For those who like this type of tepid, sweet, kisses type of romance, this will probably be a good book. For those who like their romances on the steamy side, forget this book. For those who want a true beauty and the beast story, skip this book. For me? Not my cup of tea."
1,"I saw KOYAANISQATSI when it was first released in 1983 at a special showing outdoors at the Petrillo Bandshell in Grant Park in Chicago. It was a powerful experience, with the city skyline for a backdrop. I well recall my feeling at the time, that the images were provocative and moving, but the music was intensely annoying. I WANT to like it. I fully sympathize with the message of the film, which is that our ""civilization"" is out of balance with ""nature."" I absolutely believe that we need nothing less than an ecological revolution before we destroy any more of the planet. Compassion for all sentient beings! But after repeated listening, I find the soundtrack to be yet another symptom of our out-of-sync society. I have the same reaction to most of Glass's music.If you are interested in minimalism, I recommendTerry Riley's IN CandSteve Reich's MUSIC FOR 18 MUSICIANS(see my reviews of both). These are works of beauty that may be part of the cure.Namasthe!"

1,"The blower initially worked great and the mulching feature worked well, although it most certainly did not mulch the leaves in a 16:1 ratio...more like 3:1 for oak leaves. However, while using this item today for only the 3rd time and after only about 10 minutes, it completely died. I turned the knob, and nothing happened. This blower/mulcher did not get me through a single season's leaves. Very disappointing!"
2,"These fans are sweet!! They are a bit quieter and do circulate more air throughout the system. Not to mention, your xbox 360 will look boss! (:"
2,"Bill Holdship must be living in a cave, since Mickey Gilley was popular before during and since Urban Cowboy. All the songs on this album aren't country...I agree that you can't really call this a great country album, but being from Texas, knowing the mentality of the people of that era (I would be one of Bud's contemporaries) not all 'cowboys' listened to country ONLY. Lots of the country boys I grew up with listened to rock and roll exclusively, lots listened to a mix. So the Urban Cowboy soundtrack and it's follow up album (which brought many more of the wonderful songs into the hands of the public) is an honest look at Texas twentysomething life in the late seventies/early eighties. And John Travolta played the part very well. A little over the top on the accent, but his character was from West Texas, and those people talk funny out there....LOL. So if you can get this album and its follow up, do so...you'll enjoy it for a long time to come."
2,This is a fun book that is interesting for anyone to read. It is well designed because there are journal entries as well as informative articles written by the author on every page. The illustrations are full of color and I enjoy the attention to detail that fills this book.Kristin Joy Pratt-Serafini has a talent in writing books that are fun and informative. This book details the changing of the seasons (month to month) in the desert environment as seen by a young girl and her friend.
1,Not very happy with this product. the Tape for the shuttle wings won't stick - and the fit of the hooks makes it hard to get the wings close enough to shuttle body to stick. The rocket itself is basically cardboard with a decal around it. The decal was sloppily applied. We can't fit the ring on the bottom of the rocket - kinda necessary to hold the engine in to launch rocket.Feel like I wasted my money and now I'm stuck with the launch pad and engines for a rocket we can't fly.
2,"This exceeded my expectations beyond anything I could have imagined! The detailed information was amazing and I can't wait to absorb it all. For any level of cook, this will suffice."
2,"I have tried about 10 mini pumps, but this is the best. I even bought one for my daughter. I put it in my jersey pocket instead of clipping it to the bike and it fits well. It takes a few pumps to get to 110 psi (I usually stop at about 80-90 but it feels like 110) but you get a good arm workout while you are doing it."

1,"Amazon's description was so vague I had to rely on reviews for content. Unfortunately, the reviews were based on the cassettes, not the CD, and the cassette contained the story I sought, but the CD did not. Poor product description on Amazon's part. I'll not be buying from Amazon again soon."
2,"I collect a lot of soul music and love the latin soul oldies artists like WAR, Joe Bataan, Sly Slick and Wicked, MC BLVD etcOn this cd are some rare gems by Sunny Ozuna, Benitez and Nebula, Thee Midniters and a beautiful song by MC Blvd, and a classic Malo and many others. This is a must buy if you love rare soul..Oh and the Ralfi Pagan song is a classic!! I also discovered many other great soul albums from this label..ITP Records ...I went to there website at www.itprecords.com and found some great soul oldies and a ""Rare Collection"" CD on Tierra"
1,"Although this monitor has a good picture and is priced fairly, you should think twice about purchasing a Viewsonic. Their customer service is atrocious and this is important because it will be needed if your experience is like mine: Your monitor turns itself off and degausses itself. you'll be on hold 45 minutes and pay $50 to have another shipped to you, which arrives and is ""refurbished"". Your ""refurbished"" monitor will stop waking up from sleep mode after a month or so. You'll wish you'd spent the extra $20 and got that Sony. This monitor is the Fiat of displays. You should buy two, as you'll be needing a backup."
2,"I bought this for grocery runs in my neighborhood. It can hold about 2 full grocery bags. The spring-loaded attachment is a nice feature for quick release of the basket when I get home, but we'll see how long it holds up. The handle is a pain to deal with -- always coming out of its socket and whatnot. I fashioned my own bungee-type covering so items don't fly out going over bumps. (I recommend finding some sort of cover to go with this basket if you live in a bumpy area) But all in all it fit perfectly with a bike mount I purchased at Sports Authority, and that's all that mattered at the moment was an easily mountable basket that could do the job."
1,This is way to expensive. The Wall Street Journal has no distribution expense with this edition and it is not as comprehensive as the print edition. No thanks.
2,"I cook to relax and I love food. There is nothing I prefer more than making stock and smelling it through the house. I like to experiment, but I stick to the classics. This book was not written for me. It is a textbook for American professionals, and has quantities to match. I am an Australian amateur. But I would recommend this book to absolutely everyone who already loves to cook. It is not for beginners. But if you are sick of endless recipes and cookbooks which concentrate on graphics and photography, this is for you. This book is incredibly detailed, and wonderful to read. You will never cook everything in this book. But you will learn from everything that you read in it."
2,"I have had, lost, found, and lost this book again, so I was very excited to find a copy for purchase. The book arrived very quickly, and was exactly as described online. Thank you for a good transaction."
1,This item came to me used and broken. I was highly unsatisfied with it. I Could not understand how something like that was even sent out. How-ever the passenger side mirror came new and I was pleased with it.

1,One of the most awful pieces of junk ever released. Her caterwauling will get on your nerves. They put this no-talent in the Rock and Roll hall of fame?
1,"Though I support slow food and buying from local producers, I also understand the important role corporations play in agriculture production, marketing and the international food supply. Furthermore, I believe corporations can not be demonized if they are simply doing what we as consumer demand of them. If consumers continue to demand higher quality at a lower price, more uniformity in product and longer periods of shelf stability then these corporations will not change but continue to vertically integrate, engineer and streamline production.Watch the movie but don't take it as absolute truth. A little more reading will be necessary to produce a well-rounded and adequately informed opinion on the subject. Check out this website: [...]. It provides perspective from highly respected research professors and industry professionals."
2,"I bought this for my grandson for his birthday and he loves it! He had another Thomas set that had grey plastic track which is horrible. The track will not stay together and he was very frustrated. I think the carnival set is that same track so beware. This set has sturdy durable wooden tracks and he plays with it EVERY day! He has fun moving the track in different designs and is mystified with the water ""disappearing"" from the water tower. This is the best Thomas set to start off with and it appears additional extension sets are very reasonably priced. I recommend this highly and suggest you stay away from the grey plastic track Thomas sets."
1,"I've bought tons of ethernet cables over the years, including Belkin cables, and I know there's nothing magical about ethernet cables, especially cables that are only 1 foot long. But this cable is much thinner and cheaper feeling than other Belkin cables I have, and it does not have the molded connectors that are clearly visible in the product picture. If I wanted a cable this cheap I could have just made it myself. This would probably be my first ever return to Amazon if I thought it would be worth the time. Buyer beware though..."
1,Looks are great. Item dents very easily - do not remember dropping it and there are new dents. Does not keep water cold. Top must be on tight to keep water from leaking. Top inconvenient to open and close (many turns). Difficult to clean - requires brushing. Very overpriced for thin aluminum cylinder. Either price comes down to $5 or this is a quick fad.
2,"Love them! Clean looking and the black top is nice to place a plant, office supplies, etc without fear of scratching! Ordered another one for my home office"
1,"I absolutely hate this aquarium. In fact, I am going to see if I can return it directly to the manufacturer because I've had fish in it and I don't think it would be right to return it to the store. The main reason I wanted it is because of the highly rated bio-wheel filter system. I wasn't impressed. I had this tank for two weeks and I kept up with water changes and the smell was horrible. I had to empty the tank, take everything out, throw away the filter, and disinfect the tank. The design of the tank makes it difficult and frustrating to perform maintenance. I think it is a ""pretty"" aquarium, but for my money, I wish I'd bought a cheaper, easier to maintain unit."
2,"My cats and even new pup totally adore this and have endless hours of fun! They jump on it, pull it, run through it, anything and everything you can imagine!! This a great purchase that you definitely feel you got your money is worth..:)"
2,"The product fit perfectly, as did the provided bolts. Fit and finish were excellent. The only reason I did not give this product five stars, is that they stick out away further from the bike than I like. Thinking about bending them in a bit, just worried about messing up the finish."
2,This is great for my puppy to learn to catch the frisbee. It is not good to let him tug on but it is still pretty tough even when that happens. Flies well and is easy to see. I recommend.
2,I have this DVD on VHS. Our VCR broke so that is why I ordered it on DVD. I absolutely love the workouts. They are easy to do. I would recommend this DVD for any level from a beginner exerciser all the way to an expert exerciser!
2,"Love this book. Bought another copy for a friend. It is well written and informative, and should be required reading for anyone involved with decision making for our food selection"
1,"I've worked with all sorts of photography equipment and pictures/viewing software. Never have I been as frustrated as I am with the nikon lukewarmpix950 and its lame manual and lamer software programs. Nikon is not ready for the digital photography marketplace. The camera is not intuitive to use and the viewing software is nearly imposible to work with, IF you are even able to access it. I've never seen anything like this. This is the most user-unfriendly package I've ever witnessed. If you have not worked with digital cameras and digital picture-taking extensively, DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA. YOU WILL BE SORRY!"
2,"Not the best of the Star Trek movies but none the less a must to complete the set.I paid less than $8 and got it within days, very well packaged. Great Buy!"
1,"I was very disappointed by using this MS product. I think this has not been updated since years. Many addresses are not found. It cannot communicate with my current GPS device and after few minutes "" GPS device not found"" is displayes. While my GPS utility can still see satellites and I can see data flowing.Voice prompt does not tell the name of street to turn but simply says in how many feet. In big cities where multiple highways start from one ramp, chances are to miss the right highway unless you memorize every turn before start or turn your head to look at the laptop screen which is very dangerous.Voice response is very slow and if you are driving little fast , you will miss street and will have to come back.Called customer service and they don't have any solution for compatibility problem.In big cities like Chicago or New York very hard to get signal."

1,"My friends and I actually had trouble staying awake while watching this movie. Many things were thrown at you in this movie, but little was ever explained. Cast was annoying and I couldn't have cared less if they survived or not. The usual story of a group of people trying to escape, finding a safe house, safe house gets raided, people escape to another place, and eventually finding freedom. z z zzz Again extremely boring the way it all played out in this movie."

1,"These rice cakes have very little flavor and are very crumbly. I have thrown away the equivelent to 2 from all of the crumbs. The flavor is barely there and tastes more like a rice cake than the flavor says. This flavor is slightly better than the Honey Nut flavor but still nothing but crumbs. I will go back to the Quaker brand, they are worth the extra money."
1,This book had potential but the writers blew it!! I felt like throwing the book across the room. There was way too much jumping around from character to character. While I love a surprise ending this one was poorly written and was just a dumb way to end it. The ending didn't figure in well with the rest of the book...it was more like they were tired of writing and just pulled something out of left field and stopped.Don't waste your money buying this book...borrow it if you can find someone that wasn't mad enough to throw it away or check it out from your library if you insist on punishing yourself.
1,I didn't really enjoy this cd at all. I ended up selling my cd. None of the songs were really that good...
2,"I don't have this game, but my uncle does. It is the most awesome game ever. I like the create a wrestler mode. My uncle created Rey Mysterio Jr. Anyway, this game has tons of wrestlers(too bad they don't have Goldberg), tons diffrent modes and stunning graphics. Buy this game!"
2,"P.S. I love you is a good movie, and this DVD comes with deleted scenes and a commentary (which I have yet to watch!) I don't typically like chick flicks, but I am a fan of this movie. The deleted scenes were awesome too!"
2,"There are a couple of observations that I'd make about this book: if you're looking for a gripping story, this ain't it. If you're looking for mastery of prose and a philosophical eye, this is it. Marilynne Robinson is an incredibily gifted writer, and the process/flow of this novel is exceptional. In some ways this book reminds me of Agee's A Death in the Family: nothing much happens that's extraordinary, but the mundane is bejeweled by the poetic eye Agee turns on the world. If you think Agee wrote a great novel, then this one's for you.As for the discussion about mental illness and transients. There's been a lot written in the last 40 years about the cultural underpinnings that define ""abnormal"" behavior. Maybe it says more about the reader that the reaction to the characters is one of categorization (and possible dismissal)....whereas others might be dazzled by the characterizations-- as an end in itself."
1,"Was very excited seeing the postitive reviews for the sheet set.But only after 3 weeks of use, little fuzz balls were everywhere.Not worth the money.This is the only thing I regret buying from Amazon."
2,"I read this because I so enjoyed ""A Three Dog Life,"" about a later period in the author's life after her husband suffered a traumatic brain injury. ""Safekeeping"" is not as engaging, but worth a look for those who enjoy memoirs and are interested in crafting their own."
2,"A little slow at times, but a good read. Love the mystery that was involved and always like reading about sunken treasure."
2,A wonderful magical film that I enjoyed along with my 6 year old grandaughter! Beautifully done in a sweet gentle manner. I am an artist and I just loved the way it was created.
2,"I had read the book before seeing the movie, and the thing that struck me the most while watching it was how true everything - from characters, dialogue, scenery, etc. - was to the original book. Probably due to Sherman Alexie's participation in the film.... But it's the only movie-based-on-a-book that didn't disappoint me, and in fact actually *added* to the pleasure I'd gotten from the book! Congrats to all involved!"
1,"I enjoyed Mankind's book, so I bought this one. This one was quite different. It had a ghost-writer, which is an immediate red flag. It's quite evident too, since some of the happenings in the book are out of sequence.The way the Rock talks about losing his virginity at an early age, he makes it sound like it's almost a good thing. Man, don't promote sexual activity to young kids.I haven't read a wrestling autobiography since this disappointment. My advice is this, don't buy this book, don't buy Chyna's book, don't buy Lita's book. Buy Mick Foley's book if you must read about the life of a wrestler."
2,"I have never seen this movie, I bought this album solely for the music on it. A great mix of 70's pop including songs by Abba and The Carpenters. But of course there is also some original score music too, like the wonderful orchestral ""Bridal Dancing Queen"" and ""Lonely hearts"". This album has a great mix of upbeat songs and will put anyone in a happy mood. I think I should see the movie!"
2,"This book is one that drew me in! I really enjoyed this book, from beginning to end. It covers many young people, their struggles from the beginning from the war to their end-either by their release or their untimely demise by nazi soldiers. The story gives many perspectives, with photos, and gives other information (the individuals' stories do not end at the finish of a sentence) This book did make me tear up from time to time, so you may need a box of tissues, but its hard not to get attached to the writers of this trip back into the genicide of WW2."
1,What a piece of crap! Will not stay together after being assembled CORRECTLY! My twin daughters have probably only played with this 2 or 3 times because the pieces start coming apart anytime they are touched. I certainly hope the company that made this toy sees some of these reviews and makes improvements.

2,"I bought this pregnancy test because I had already taken two First Response Pregnancy tests and both showed a faint line in the window indicting that I was pregnant but I wanted to be absolutely sure with something that I didn't have to interpret. I bought this test and took it yesterday and the readout on the test is still there. I had read on the package that the result will remain on the product for twenty four hours but this one has lasted longer than that.Overall, this was a simple, accurate test (went to the doctor's to double check today), and the battery power is great."
2,"If that's your thing, this is your book. If you're looking for Java design pattern implementations (as I was), there are better choices out there."
1,"There are major holes in this software if your doing any of the TSR campaign setting. It doesn't cover gods and the kits can be a pain to fit in. The software has limits on how well things are linked up. If your running ""Plane Scape"" or ""Ravenloft"" don't waist your time here. You can add the races and classes for these settings but the time it would take you to add these races isn't worth the effort. Crack the books open.With that said here are the good parts. You can make new monsters, races and classes. You can do some mapping and you have all the core books. I don't know about a lot of you but I'm not looking forward to 3rd edition. This product gives you the core books on disk so if you want to play 2nd edition you have them forever. We all know how well the TSR books are made. Any one remember ""Unearthed Arcana"" I do."
1,"Levi's 569s were always my favorite jeans. However, as others have stated, Levi's has for some reason decided to change the fit. The new 569s are NOT loose fit jeans. I would classify them as relaxed fit. If you want relaxed fit, go ahead and buy these. If you want a loose fit, you'll need to find a different pair of jeans. I am now lost as to what jeans to buy. Hopefully Levi's will wake up and realize they are losing long-time loyal customers and fix the problem. SEVERELY DISAPPOINTED!!!"
2,"""Semi-Tough"" is not a movie for everyone. For those who love sports, sick humor and love the politically incorrect, this is definitely your movie. Dan Jenkins (suthor) makes great fun of pro football and the preliminaries leading to the Super Bowl. While the movie is about a Texas team (the Dallas Cowboys?), the foibles are applicable to most pro teams. Sex, boozing, and offbeat behavioral science are the ingredients, Jill Clayburgh, Robert Preston,Burt Reynolds and Kris Kristopherson are the players and they are downright fun, if a tad unbelievable at times (remember, this is a spoof). While it fails to reach the hilarity of the book, this movie provides more than its share of laughs, many giggles, and some downright guffaws. It is not for the politically correct or weak of heart!"
2,"If you like westerns? This is the ultimate. With awesome cinematography. YOU HAVE TO SEE AND GET IN WIDESCREEN!! A story about friendship, revenge, and family. It is my all time favorite western..with Tombstone, Unforgiven and, Shane close behind! Pay atention to the last words of the movie..spoken by Kevin Costner.... ""We'll be back!"" Ive been waiting for a sequal ever since!! YOU WILL LOVE IT!!"
2,"For the uninitiated, ""Everyday Karma"" does bring Karma into the realm of everyday life...simple explanations yet intriquing and understandable concepts. Satisfies the curious; affirms the believer; encourages the doubter. A subtle confirmation of holstic possibilities and affirming acknowledgement of everyone's potential to access the intuitive."
1,After about 3 months it falls off the faucet and is no longer useable. A big waste of money. We had problems with another PUR model leaking so we thought this one might be better. Not at all.

The amazing odyssey through the shifting political times ofthese three strong women reflects the horror endured by the survivors ofthis complex nation. - Barbara, multiculturalism, http://multicultural.miningco.com"

1,"Mr. Callahan's advice for selecting an architect is very bad advice. If a Building Committee follows his advice they will not receive the professional architectural services that they deserve. I am an architect who has specialized in designing churches for over 20 years. Mr. Callahan obviously does not understand or appreciate the full services that an architect who specializes in church architecture can provide. His suggestion to use a ""architectural study process"" is only going to result in participation of less qualified architects providing unsatisfactory design services. I would hope that anyone reading this book will be able to understand that this system is doomed for failure.Robert H. Amor, Church Architect"
2,"This CD is certainly one of the GREATEST Cds I've EVER purchased. Not only is it made up of their voices and no instruments, but the way they have technologized it in such a way makes it the best one they have out...in my opinion. They have definitely outdone themselves this time around and I'm sure they'll keep on doing it til they cant anymore. Jons percussion is the most amazing thing and Mikes knack for writing songs is top notch!! THEY R GREAT!!"
1,"Just absolutely terrible. Do yourself a favor, don't purchase. Not anything like I'd thought it be. I got suckered! This DVD should recieve a zero star."
2,"This book is full of historical facts. It is thick and not a simple read, but full of good information."
2,Freddie Highmore does an outstanding job in his performance in August Rush. The story plot is portrayed in a believable series of events and Robin Williams also does a good job portraying the semi-villain in this movie. This is a bit of a tear-jerker but pleasant none-the-less and with the inevitable happy ending.

It also has thestandard stereo outputs to drive an external soound system for all threeRPMs. All this and it's built to pack around.My wife called it one of the best electronics purchases I've ever made..

2,"I just read ""Sounds Design"" and it REALLY changed everything for me, and where I want to take my life. I won't make this a long message but long story short, I've been doing sound design for about a year (though I've been engineering for much longer) and I was doing it ALL WRONG. The thought process I mean. Now my two main questions for everything I make a sound for is ""Does it need any sound? (Silence?)"" and ""Why?"" Choosing what to make a sound with, and why I'm looking for those characteristics psychologically. I've grown an imense love and respect for the art. Thank you David.Sound Design: The Expressive Power of Music, Voice and Sound Effects in Cinema"
1,I have owned this camera for 16 months. I'd guess I am an average user in respect to how often I use the camera. I have taken extremely good care of it. Not a single mark on it. One day it just stopped working. Wouldn't turn on. It's currently at Minolta to be fixed to the tune of $160. Personally I find this unacceptable. My suggestion is to look at other brands.

1,Made for tv movie from the popular books. Movie was a bit cheesy. Overacting is key. Too good of actors for such a bad script. Adam Beach and Wes Studi were poorly casted for such an amature movie. I couldn't possibly dumb down their talent for this case.
2,"Lord of the G-Strings may simply be one of the funniest movies I've ever watched. I rented it in hopes that the girls would be cute and the jokes would be somewhat funny. Both hopes were met and then some...Missie Mundae is just adorable! And I mean not only in physical appearance, but also in the way that she talks and acts. You'd never expect it from a porn star, but she is as funny and charming as she is sexy.The scenes are hilarious...we're talking about humor in the tradition of ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" (another classic parody), complete with jokes about the actors themselves, anachronisms, and more.This is a rare diamond in the dirt of unrated-low-budget-movies-that-are-really-just-pornos-except-you-can-get-them-from-any-video-store.

1,"I have watched almost all the jane austen movies, pride and prejudice, sense and sensibility, emma, and mansfield park. I have loved each of these and have and will watch them over and over. This Northanger Abbey was not as much like her other stories. It has a little darkness in its story line, something I am not accustomed to seeing in Jane Austen stories. I must say I will not be watching this one again."
1,I guess if you miss puppet humor from back when it was done well... This just isn't funny.
2,"The mother reminds me of myself and my mother. I'm not tech-savy and I keep a lot in the freezer. Easy to follow, very funny and relatable."
2,"I just got this thing three weeks ago. Yes, using it was painful, but bareable. You have to have a great deal of patience to do your whole legs (and mine are pretty hairy). The only problem that lots of people mentioned..afterwards you get red ""bumps"", which I found a simple solution for. I just used a wet hot towel over my legs for 5-10 min, changing it periodically and that took care of the redness. After that I used baby powder, and that also helps the skin to heal and prevents the infection."
2,"Through all the sappy and stupid hippie movements and protest songs in the 60s (1..2..3 What are we fighting for? AHHHHH, albeit some songs weren't bad), Frank Zappa came out and finally had the balls to give a very unpopular opinion on a subject many in the musick industry succumbed to. Lyrically, this album puts down the hippies and the squares, and hints that the whole thing is dumb. Musically, it is greatly complex and intricate to support those lyrics. The hippie's idea that the government could do no right. The government's idea that the hippies were the most dangerous threat to society. The police and their A**holedness (which still exists today as always, because it is a job for people who want POWER). Zappa brought all these aspects to a head. Just about every sociological problem that could be expressed was. Many say Dylan was best at protest music, and while this album may appear to mock protest musick, it is ironically protest music."
1,Really had high expectations of this Kona coffee--so much so that I even gifted a couple of bags for Christmas. I was not impressed and very much regretted gifting this coffee.
2,Had squirrels feeding like mad; this stopped them. Birds feed; squirrels cannot. Larger capacity than I expected. I would recommend.
1,"Please, please, please, please, PLEASE bring back the old Spearmint Altoids flavor! They used to be my favorite type of Altoids until this New ""Great"" Taste came and ruined them. This new flavor is not sweet at all and just tastes all-around disgusting. It's bitter and tastes like those foul cough drops that, no matter how bad a cough I had, I would never make myself take. You took a wonderful thing and changed it for the worse - much worse. Please revert back to the old recipe!"
1,"1/ You were not sure Orson Welles was a genius, so you needa comparison with the same basics (his script)2/ You're allergic to black & white movies3/ You're more interested in munching pop-corn, and do'ntwant distraction by a more compelling show4/ You're so much addicted to TV style that you can't standany longer quality movies with perfect acting and directingBut for those, I can't think of ANY REALLY GOOD reason for this remake"
1,"I rarely give up on a book. I got to Chapter 49, still waiting to become interested in the book, and finally decided I was just too bored with the book to continue."
2,"This featured Nat ""King"" Cole as the lead pianist,and since he is my favorite jazz pianist it was an easy choice."
1,"Sux.the title is what is wrong.Says for ALL Motorola phones.I have a Motorola i560,i710,i730,and it didn't list any of them.threw it away.thanks."
2,I bought this for my son's MP3 player and it works great. No problems and no speed issues. Great Price....
1,I ordered this item for an 80s themed party I am having and it came without the ball. I probably would not order products from this company.
2,"I would thoroughly recommend the full series to anyone! I'm not a big anime fan myself but after receiving the first three bolunes my thirst for this series became intolerable. I LOVED it!Never have I laughed and cried at such captivating animation, 5 stars!More please!"
2,"This is a cute little movie. It is not laugh-out-loud funny, but it is a sweet romantic comedy: A man discovers a way to control everyone else in the world, but he chooses to _not_ control the woman he loves, allowing her to decide for herself whether she wants to be with him.The fact that the movie involves religious ideas has sent a lot of people into a tizzy. But the real commentary on religion and beliefs can be found by reading between the lines of the one-star reviews here.A nice film about relationships, followed by some sociological lessons here. Good value for your money."
1,"I bought this scale to keep track of my weight loss and exercise program. This scale does not take an accurate weight. Even if I have just been to the doctor's office, the scale will say that I have gained 10 lbs in a 15 minute drive. Despite reading the manual and following the directions, this scale is next to impossible to program. Maybe I have a defective scale, but based on the other reviews, I doubt it."
1,"If you care whether filthy language and explicit sex scenes are in the novels you buy, save your money and skip this one. The plot was intriguing, but couldn't get through it."
1,"I bought this product with very high expectations. Silly me. No matter how many tries, no matter how much advice and valiant effort from technical support, no matter how many work arounds attempted, my computer and the scanner could not connect; i.e. the USB connection did not work. Shortly after I finally gave up, I installed a new digital camera, also calling for an USB connection (natch) with no problems at all. My suspicion is that the scanner is not at all comfortable with XP, which is on my system. But whatever the reason, the scanner failed to install, I returned the product for a credit, and commented to the technical support that ""It simply shouldn't be this hard."""
1,"I brought one from Costco and only used for 8 month, now the lid need to be replaced and it will cost me $35.00. Stat away from this product, actually stay away from this Brand name. it sucks."
2,This thing really works. I tried the exercises and noticed HUGE improvement in my memory and the ability to visualize things in a way I had never dreamed before.
2,"Bought this book in anticipation of a trip to WDW in 2007, but got to use it on a spontaneous trip to WDW a couple of weeks ago. We had just one day to make our travel arrangements. Found a great package deal through Priceline for air, hotel (Dolphin) and car. Had one day at Magic Kingdom, and followed the books tips and touring plan. Saw almost all of the Kingdom in 12 hours, including all the top attractions. For a quick trip through the Magic Kingdom, this book was the only way we could have seen and done everything we did.We'll be going back next summer, and the 2007 edition will be on an Amazon order as soon as it's available."
2,Excellent book. This would be a great book for people unfamiliar with Robert Crumb. I've got a fairly good collection of his work and I saw many things here that I never saw before. Must have book for Crumb readers!
1,"He should have been institutionalized for his own safety and the safety of others. He made numerous threats against respected academic researchers and heavily exagerated claims of his own first hand knowledge on these matters, especially regarding Majestic 12. He was also connected to the extreme right-wing, anti-tax movement, though he was not an official member of any militia. Not only did most abduction researchers shun anything he said, but even former associate Bob Lazar (the discredited Area 51/S-4 guy) distanced himself from Cooper. The man became increasingly unstable and by the end was wanted by the U.S. Marshalls on felony charges. On 11/5/2001, police attempted to serve an unrelated warrant against him for assault and endangerment. He opened fire and shot one of them in the head. The remaining deputies returned fire and killed Cooper."
1,"""Women blame men for acting fake.... But women are the ones speeding from zero to intimacy like a Ferrari. Which is more artificial?"" asked Marin in one of his failed attempts at wisdom about dating. He was talking about a girl who had come to visit him from Europe (he invited her), where they had met and had sex, and who didn't like the fact that he was sleeping around.This is the dictionary definition of intimate:(adj.) having, or being likely to cause, a very close friendship or personal or sexual relationshipSo he criticized a girl --and women in general-- for acting as if an intimate act were, well, an intimate act.Marin is not only a jerk but much worse: he's a writer so bad he doesn't even know the meaning of the words he uses."
2,"Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan go together like bacon and eggs - and are usually just as down-home wholesome.Remember the ooold one with Deborah Kerr and Cary Grant? This is pretty much the same tale except there's no kid added to the mix in the original. You've got your romantic comedy shtick of a recently-engaged women in NY who hears about a recently widowed man (with a young son) in Seattle and somehow forms the conviction that they're destined to be together. Complex miscommunications, bad karma, minor accidents - all sorts of stuff threaten the pre-ordained meeting on the roof of a skyscraper from happening, but of course it eventually does (thanks to the kid), and the rest is, shall we say, cinema history.Written down like this, it sounds cheesy. It's not. Curl up on a rainy night with a lover and some nice wine and this video, and who needs to go out on the town?"
1,"...then don't bother with this! The story started off with good possibilities but when it went off on that brother-sister love jag it got nauseating. I haven't seen the Manga, just this OVA but am glad I only rented it not bought it."
2,I cannot say enough good things about this soundtrack. Every track makes me smile and remember the scenes of one of my most favorite musicals. My 4 yr old loves to dance and sing to the music and that makes my heart happy to introduce another generation to the lovely sounds of musicals. A great purchase and addition to your cd collection.
1,I have only given it one star because there is no option for zero stars.I have owned one of these routers for several months. It is a totally unreliable piece of crap.Constantly fails to connect to web sites. Constantly needs to be de-powered and re-powered to establish a connection. Do a little research and you will find many people with the same problem/opinion. Stores should not be selling this product at any price. Caveat emptor!
2,"Marcio has always been an excellent musician and this album is just the perfect example, his skills, his taste, his collaboration with genius Licoln Olivetti and their compositions for the trumpet and flügelhorn are awesome. Most every cut in this album is fantastic, Hidden Place and Aquarela do Brasil are soft, sultry, melodic; and cuts like Terra Mater / Oberdan's Groove / Reunion / The 14th Day / Take your Time and One More Light are fast-paced Brazilian Instrumental Jazz at its best.Include it in your collection !..."
2,"These CD's (it's a set of 2) are THE best music I have EVER heard. The quality is top notch and the selections are amazing. I have it in my car and have not been able to change to any other CD's. I play it louder and louder and louder. I am not a fan of loud music but this music BEGS to be loud. The variety is amazing. Every song becomes my favorite until I hear the next cut. I believe this set captures the true sense of countries best musicians both vocal and instrumental. As each song progresses you actually get carried away with the rhythms.The way the cuts are placed in the CD's flow and you're on your way into the world of worldly music. I cannot recommend it highly enough, it needs more than 5 stars! Not to be missed!"
2,I was a little disappointed in no. 6. The preface was hype for a series that doesn't need it.The story was very funny-- but I am beginning to feel like I'm watching a half hour comedy series that comes out once a year and never goes anywhere.
2,"With this book you can actually create wonderful ideas for your students, the only things is not very good for little ones is must be for older kids that understand the idea of bilingual books"
1,"STICK WITH THE ORIGINAL BOX SET.A WASTE OF MONEY!!John L. BookPalm Springs, Ca."
1,"Peter Hamilton would have written a great book if his entire saga would start and end in one book. As it is, the majority of things are just a rehash of one of the previous books. Skip this one!"
1,Terrible Movie Waste of money and time. Horrible acting I wish I could get a refund. The story line was extremely lame
1,"My 4 year old was playing with this doll after owning it for an entire 2 days and the arm broke in half. The clothes are very nice but the doll itself is not worth the investment. Besides breaking, Julian's hair is stiff and glued together. We have had Daniel from Swan Lake for over 1 year and have never had any problems. I will be saving Julian's clothes and handing them down to Daniel...."
1,"This is probably the worst book I have ever had the displeasure to read. Bought this before going to Philadelphia and had trouble getting through any chapter given the author's boring style. Half of the reviews were wrong in my opinion and the other half of the places rated as good were closed (looks like diners got to vote him wrong before I did). Save your money and avoid this book and any places in it, this guy has no clue"
1,"My old friend who used to play guitar for THE Army Band suggested this book to me. Realizing that coming from opposite sides of music spectrum, before using this book one may consider. My friend's career is Jazz and playing guitar as his living and I am a full time tech guy who just want to learn guitar at night by myself. Understanding pedagogy, this book is extremely useful if you are having a teacher, explain theories and walking you through all exercises. On the other hand, for beginners, explainations are at a minimum for how things are the way they are......I lost my interest simply because the learning procedures are not designed for someone whose basis of learning is pure self intructional."
1,"This album could have been a classic if Billy Corgan had reigned it in to 40 - 50 minutes, instead of the 73 minute drone here. There are moments of real beauty and great atmosphere, but by the end of it I just wanted it to stop. Please, make it stop!I've heard that their next album is going to be another double disk like ""Mellon Collie."" Doesn't this guy ever shut up?"
1,Bought it as a gift for Christmas. Looks fine. Have not taken it out of package. Hopefully it will be fine. will update after Christmas. Got here fast.Update: Watched it with wife. Worst movie ever. Awful. Do not buy! Kill it with fire!
2,"I first read The E Myth Revisited as I was preparing a local policy and procedure manual for my second small business, a national franchise. As I read the book a light bulb went off - in fact several light bulbs flashed - and suddenly I realized why small business seemed so difficult. I had indeed been more of a technician in my first business - working more IN the business than ON the business. I am now a Small Business Consultant and Michael Gerber's words ""Work ON your Business, not IN your business"" still guide me today.Dick Bendtzen, Author of ""Yes You Can Start And Run A Small Business"", and Principal of Small Business Yes You Can LLC."
2,"Gift for my 5 year old son. He loves it! You can see the moon really well. It is a little difficult to adjust it and keep everything lined up where you can see what you are aimed at. Would be nice to have it lock or something. Overall, it is good for beginning."
2,"Although I would have appreciated a little more explanation of JavaScript concepts, this book works as advertised. And for $18, it can't be beat."
1,"Though the concept of a new paradigm of consciousness and reality was interesting, what did the story about the deaf photographer have to do with it? Was that necessary to spread the message, and if it was, why did it have to be so annoyingly disjointed. At least it annoyed me! Plus, I fell asleep toward the end. I guess I will have to read the book!"
1,This is a horrible product. It sharpens unevenly and doesn't last. I bought it for my classroom and it didn't last a week. It doesn't produce a sharp point and only works when there are no shavings in the container. It fills up quickly and is not meant for more than a pencil a day. Huge waste of money. Find a different brand and save your money.
2,"I'm sorry, I've never read any of PeterTremaine's books. I buy them as gifts for my daughter-in-law. I cannot express an opinion."
2,"If all you know of this Irish-Canadian, reggae-inspired rapper is ""Informer,"" then you need to check out this release. Snow's as melodic and inventive as Funki Porcini or Transglobal Underground. And, he's as political and multi-ethnic as the rants of the Beastie Boys, Ozomatli and Asian Dub Foundation! Hard to believe, I know, but it's true."
1,"Listen, I love Ted Poley's voice (I'm a huge D2 fan), but I can't recommend this CD. Ted is WAY out of tune on many of the songs here. They sound like they have the potential to be cool tunes, then Ted just loses his way. Played this for a friend, and we were both just cringing at times. I don't know if a stronger producer and a bigger budget would've helped-probably. If you're expecting to hear the Ted Poley voice from the first 2 Danger Danger albums, you're going to be disappointed."
2,This album/disc is legendary. A bonus is that this CD is one of the best sounding of the cross-over Cds available. Watson's voice jumps out of your stereo with a full and rich tone. Russell invested much love and care in producing this disc. Thank you Russell and England for introducing him to America.
2,"Citizen Women's Eco-Drive Stiletto watch #EG3000-54AI wanted a thin watch that would look good with jeans or evening wear. This is a classic, fits flat, is comfortable and can be sized to a small wrist. The diamonds are tasteful. The watch says quality and understated elegance. Very smooth, no rough edges, the clasp is hidden and it never needs a battery."
2,"I was an eco major in college so many years ago and wished to reacquaint myself with Keynes in light of the recent upheavals in the market. I found the Skidelski abridged book very informative in describing the development of Keynes thinking and very balanced about reporting his personal foibles without being judgemental. Skidelski's 3 volumes on Keynes are the deffinitive work on perhaps the most influential economist of the 20th century. The abridged version is complete , very well written and an easy read if you have had at least an undergrad college level eco 101 background. If you are interested in the economic history of the WWI, depression and WWII periods then this very complete bio of Keynes is also very good."
2,"Final Doom is a great game for hardcore Doom fans who just can't get enough. Although somewhat unoriginal, the game doesnt dissapoint. I recommend it to any doom fan."
2,"Tight, solid riffs. Subversive and hilarious lyrics on par (no, better!) than the best of Barenaked Ladies or They Might Be Giants. And, of course, terrific tongue-in-cheek Jewish humor, just in time for most bittersweet time of the year for the Diasporized.Please, don't buy this album if you are content to sing ""I Have a Little Dreidel"" all December. It'll be wasted on you--buy it for your hip nephew instead."
2,"Die hard 1 is a classic. Die hard 2 & 3 just plain sucked! I didn't think old Brucey could pull it off again. Then as the movie progressed I found myself laughing more and rooting for him again as I did in the original. sure I would have changed a couple of unbelievable feats, but isn't that what movies are created for...to escape the real world! I wouldn't say this was better then the original. I would say it was just as entertaining. Im glad I bought it. I wont tell you the price cause I don't want my review to be deleted. But suffice to say I got the 2 disc version really cheap and it was worth every penny!"
1,Love the movie and wanted it in my collection but it came from England and wouldn't play in my DVD player.
2,"these seems to fit properly and have maintained their structure throughout washing-----so, I am not sure where all the negative comments came from regarding these shirts. Perhaps they have improved? In any case, these are fine and I will re-purchase another set from Amazon in the future."
1,"My daughter has been asking for a large dollhouse since she was 4 but we waited until we knew she would be able to take care of it and use it properly. We finally decided on this dollhouse and when we got it we found the thing is made of cardboard and particle board with very few actual braces made of real wood. There isn't enough hardware to keep the thing together and it broke almost immediately despite very gentle use by my mature seven-soon to be eight- year old. She was devastated. I found a much better dollhouse by Imaginarium that is almost the same price as this. To me the extra 10.00 is worth it knowing that my daughter will have a dollhouse she can actually USE. Please don't buy this dollhouse, you will be dissapointed. Instead check out the Glitter Dreams Dollhouse or the Uptown Dollhouse both by Imaginarium."
2,"Taking Chance is a humanitarian story involving a little known part of a soldier's loss of life. Inspired by the true story of United States Marine, Lieutenant Colonel Michael Strobl, who volunteered to escort the remains of a nineteen year old soldier (Lance Corporal Chance Phelps) who was killed during active duty in Iraq to his final resting place in distant Wyoming. Strobel, (Kevin Bacon) makes it his personal mission to prepare this young soldier for his journey home with respectful honor while gaining further insight of human sacrifice. A compassionate story."
2,"""A Leg to Stand On"" is a book documenting proprioceptional difficulties that Dr. Sacks experienced after an unfortunate encounter with a angry bull. This book is particularly revealing to me--it is the first account I read of someone (other than myself) describing their leg as having a ""will of its own."" Many years ago, I was run over by a taxi while crossing the street as a pedestrian. I still use a cane and I still encounter that ""not exactly my own"" feelings about my left leg daily.For more book reviews, please visit:[...]"
1,"i was skeptical when buying this cd. i liked there other 2 cds, but i knew there was a different singer. i thought...ok so it'll be a little different. different was RIGHT. it sucked. song after song of screaming vocals, messy tempos, and pure vanilla, meaning that it ALL sounded the same. what were they thinking? well, at least they've improved by dropping their ex piece of crap singer. and now they're but more appealing. but NEVER EVER even think about buying this cd or you will sincerely regret it."
2,This product works as good as name brand. Not sure why people say it's different. Like the results and the price.KZ
2,"I use these for my bank owned listings, and I always keep buying them. They aren't the cheapest option out there, but they are hard to break into."
1,"Like everyone else I purchased one of these to keep myself from the toxins in our plastic water bottles. I couldn't stomach the awful taste of the water from these. The water tasted of metal. I washed it with baking soda, then vinegar and still the taste remained. So, I'm back to plastic and drinking more water than ever. Huge waste of money for me!"
2,"We had been wanting one of these for some time, and Amazon had a large selection and great prices. This one works great, and our two boys just love it. It easy easy to attach, easy to assemble all the attachments, and it rolls behind your bike like there is nothing there. The construction is good and as with one review I based nearly my entire decision on, the bottom (where their feet go) is not a solid base so we have to make sure the kids don't stand in it when they climb in. We don't get to use it as much as we like, but it says it can take 2 kids up to 50 lbs each, so we have several more years to use it. Now what do we do with the 3rd kiddo on the way? LOL!"
2,Lovely story. Little misunderstanding near the end and dragged a bit but not too much.Happy ending for all. Samantha and Eric are great together. I do love about how they put the other person first instead of thinking of themselves.Would love to see Hubert and all his crazy experiments in his own little romance novel. Very smart kid.
1,"This video is full of hippie people talking about ""tantra"" like it's the holy grail. Some of it is valuable, but I couldn't stand watching the hairy armpits and ""natural"" people. A little hollywood could help these folks appeal to the mainstream. It's just icky how googly-eyed they are - very sappy!There is a lot of time spent on subjects that may not matter to you - like premature problems. Had to turn it off in the middle because the sex scenes were just nauseatingly gooey sweet and the people are way too scary looking.Here's the message of the video so far: spend at least a few hours enjoying each other once a week and set the stage with candles, music, etc. Stare into each other's eyes A LOT and go slowly. Add women with saggy and hairy parts and gray-haired mens' backs and that's the video. Now you can send me your money you just saved."
1,i love this cd i dont have it at my house my friend julia her mom has it and anytime i go somewhere we listen to this cd my favorite song is the sign i love that song it rocks wen i get in there car and julia wants a cd in missy her mom says wait a sec we have to listen to katie's song first i also likethe song (all that she wants) thats also a great song ok g2g:katie-lynn
1,"BORING AND STUPID! The movie stars with some bad magic soldier guys that are killing people in a kung fu way. Then, no action until the middle of the film which you can see a war between humans and dragons in the city. Then, no action until the last three minutes that leads to the COOL one to one final battle of the two dragons.I thought that Dragon Wars was about a war between dragons, not humans! the only good stufs were the special effects that were AWESOME! Some human fights and the war in the city which was well edited. The rest was lame. Not to mention the bad acting.P.S: Don't let the cover fool you. Rent it before you buy it!adios."
2,"Can he top ""Vol 2... Hard Knock Life""? Ummm Let's see... YES. This is an awsome CD, and unlike ""Hard Knock Life"" the tracks aren't dominated by guest appearances. GO BUY IT! Tracks 2, 4, and 7 are killer."
1,"I expected an informative, humerous, insightful book of some quantity, and quality. I received a soft cover book of 149 text pages that were repetitive, and admittedly plagiarized. I was charged $15.00 for this ""book"" and you now have it for $12, which is still too much."
2,"This film requires that you surrender any notions of the feasibility of the actual plot, but it is nonetheless an enchanting tale. If you enjoyed ""Sliding Doors"" or if you believe in fate, you'll particularly enjoy this. The film is beautiful, with indelible images that still haunted my memory years after I first saw this film - which is why I finally decided to purchase it. The end (and, in appropriate ""circular"" fashion, the beginning) will leave you mystified and breathless."
1,"I used this with three sixth graders and a fifth grader. Not great results. Too complicated for the kids to stick with. I had fun putting mine together, though.:)"
2,"The thing did well for a while. It has no tuner, but you can run cables from other places. The dvd player often stops in the middle of the movie and no way can I restart it. Other times, it displays just snow. I thought it was a bad dvd but the disk works fine on other players. Toshiba had problems with this a while back, but it is still junk. This will be my last Toshiba product."
1,"This product was so sensitive to interference from other devices that even after powering off all the cordless phones in the house, powering down all PCs with wireless and the wirelesss router, my neighbors equipment still caused static in the picture. BTW the distnace between transmitter and receiver was 10 feet without any obstructions at all.. What a waste of money.There should be a lower rating than 1 for this one..."
1,"If you've ever seen this woman's video for N***ie (the same song as P***y [Real Good]), you know this woman cannot rap. She makes Charli Baltimore and Khia look like Biggie and Tupac. Her rhymes are comparable to the worst St. Louis-based rapper ever, J-Kwon. There are other female rappers out there, and most of them can rhyme better than Jacki-O."
2,"With great anticipation I waited for this game, only to find that it was not supported on my XBox 360! Luckily I still have the old standard Xbox and it's a good thing I do. I really enjoyd the game, though the players are a bit small, even on my large screen TV. It is a complicated game (as is the real version)and it can be hard to control, but once you get the hang of it is is a blast. I wish there was the ability to play online, and an XBOX 360 version would be even better, but I owuld reccoemnd this for hardcore Rugby fans....just wish Ireland's Call played at the beginning of the Celtic Tiger's matches!"
2,Great Great great. I started off watching because of nagging co-workers i told them im tired of zombies vampires and Wolves. I started to watch on a promise to try it and 3 season later im hooked. season 3 is awesome the sword lady is my favorite cant wait to see the second half
2,"I have read this book 4 times, and I can read it 100 times more, and never get tired of it. This is what a great piece of literture can do. This book has such unforgetable scenes, that one cannot differenciate between dream and reality that exists in the story, but takes over your mind and don't let go till you set aside the book. And even after, you will be captivated by the imagineray that has gone into this masterpiece."
2,"Lil' Kim's new CD Notorious K.I.M. shows her musical growth as well as her smooth attempt of targeting a wider audience. Some of her songs don't have the proper production to help her go in the direction she's trying but for the most part this album is tight. She's still hardcore and nasty but she's also more lyrical and versatile on this album. For those who say she still talks nasty on this album... big deal! I don't see anyone critisizing Too $hort for talking about pimping hoes on all 10 of his albums, so whats the difference. Lil' Kim this album is tight and as long as theres going to be a Lil' Kim there are going to be haters. And like your first single says ""No matter What People Say..You got it going on..Who cares about what they think..you are the number one"" obviously- haters check the billboard!"
1,"I would have been pleased with this radio since the sound is good but one of the speakers does not work. After trying four different stereo headphones, I knew for sure that only one speaker worked when using headphones. I called Sony who, after asking stern questions about how long I had the radio ( I received it from Amazon that very day!) finally told me to mail it back at my expense. I am not pleased with this situation at all. I have to wonder if Sony tested this item before it was shipped out.It would also be nice if the radio had a carrying handle and came with headphones. It would also be nice if it could run on AC/DC power."
2,"This game always seems to get a bad rap. While not perfect, Full Auto is definitely worth the 18-20 dollar price tag (used). Sure, the cars handle like matchbox cars and the framerate is not too stable at times, but there is plenty of fun to be had in this racer. Destroying stuff hasn't gotten old for me yet, especially with Xbox Live multiplayer; a suite of instant action modes; splitscreen; and a lenghty career mode. The graphics are pretty wonderful except for the aforementioned slowdown during camera cuts and intense sequences, cars deform differently depending on where they're hit and there's always something blowing up. Unwreck is pretty nifty too. It's kinda the videogame equivalent of a Clive Cussler novel or Jeanne Claude Van Damme movie. Light on the depth, a little derivative, and heavy on the action. Enjoy!"
1,"Yet another reissue of the 1963 live tracks captured at the Club A Go-Go in Newcastle by Giorgio Gomelsky for his excellent Rock Generation series on the French BYG label, a well documented 12 volume set of admittedly seat-of-the-pants recordings documenting the early British Blues scene.It has been reissued endless times on budget labels like Springboard and Trip with misleading covers, the wrong playing order, and ridiculous liner notes. This is another one of those- and there are only five of the usual seven songs on this. You should to be able to find these tracks elsewhere for under a dollar.I Got to Find My Baby, Bo Diddley, I'm Almost Grown, Dimples, Boom Boom."
1,"Cynical awful film, poorly done, poorly acted and misleading. Joel McCrea is not the star of it. His bland son Jody is. Joel Mcrea hardly has any lines and appears only at the beginning and the end, mostly riding on horse with nothing to do."

2,"I got this book for college. It served its purpose and got me through my math class. I did like their examples in the book showing you step by step on how to execute certain problems. The book itself wasn't in the greatest condition, but that's what I paid for. Really good buy if you need it for school."
2,"this is a good book. It had a lot of action a little romance and a lot of twists and turns i am enjoying the series so far. Each book can stand on it's own but i recommend that you read them in order because each book is related to the ones before,the plot gets wider and more bizzar as the series grows. This series reminds me of the show (on Si-Fi)Dark angel."
1,As happy as I was to be reading a Patricia Cornwell again and Kay Scarpetta with all her friends and colleagues...the ending was extremely disappointing. It left me with the impression that her editor called and said...'hurry up and finish it anyway you can!' I'm willing to give the next one a read but should it be as disappointing as this one...then Ms. Cornwell should retire this series all together.
1,"This textbook has several problems with the layout and editing that make it very difficult to understand. One of the areas that needs improvement is the diagrams and figures, which are printed with such poor quality that they are difficult to read. Also there are numerous instances were equations are printed with incorrect subscripts and supporting information; therefore, I think that this book would not be a good buy for students or anyone else for that matter."
1,"I understand Horror Movies can't Be Horror Movies without twists and turns and even Yes Awful Endings! I think this Movie was Wrong, The Ending is what Makes me give this 1 star, Just the Ending, The Movie as a whole is 2 stars-3 in a half, The Descent was A Way Better Movie."
1,"I bought one of these for my shepherd mix dog. My dog ripped it almost immediately, and from there, it went downhill fast. Well, I though it was probably my fault for letting him keep it too long between throws (since he liked to chew it). So, I bought another one and made sure to get it back from my dog after every throw. In just under two months, it is in the garbage. This is not worth the money."
2,"My 7 year old son really likes GI Joe, so when he received a DragonHawk for Christmas, he was eager to save up for accessories to go with it. He bought the Mantis and enjoys that as much as the DragonHawk. Good purchase; a lot of fun."
2,"I have a pop and crackel LP version of this wonderfully spacey, psychedelic soundtrack as well as a VHS copy of this dated, but era representative movie. I can confirm that 16 minutes of the original soundtrack including the trax ""Joint Passing"", ""A Little Head"", ""Inner Pocket"", ""The Other Ed Norton"", ""Peter Gets Off"" and ""Gettin"" Hard""; all but one of which are excellent instrumentals with atmosphere and attitude; have indeed been left off the CD for some unexplainable reason. Given the poor audio quality of my vintage LP and despite the missing 6 trax; I may have to purchase the CD to enjoy most of it in clear digital sound. The movie, the music and the era may be passe for most X & Y generations, but for us old pot heads ""The Trip"" is a fine reminder of our ""Happy Days"".....Enjoy....The TUNEMAN from the Great White North 03 Nov 2000"
2,this looks just like advertised. i would recommend this to anyone who was interested in pool accessories. Great for a gift.
2,Really wanted this cd which was out of print. Now I have a collectors item. I love it.
1,"Despite the quote from Ms. L'Engle that she ""expected it to be terrible"" I decided to give this movie a chance thanks to Netflix streaming.I can't understand why Ms. L'Engle would allow one of the best pieces of children's literature ever written to be turned into cinematic vomit. This movie made me want to never ever see another Disney production for the rest of my life.If you grew up with this book and treasure it, do yourself and your fond memories of it a favor and don't let a DVD of this movie in your house. The only reason I gave this movie one star is because they don't offer a lower rating on Amazon."
1,"If I could just find out how long to put it on the face, how often per week etc. Everything is in Japanese, and the little label that is stuck over in English language for instructions, is so small, I can't even make out what's up with reading glasses. And I don't really have usually problems with my eye sight when it comes to reading as I am narrow sighted."
2,You can't beat the price for this wheelchair. Its great for transporting people in places like wal-mart and target. It is construted for the average person. I used it for a person that weighed 170lbs.. The footrest are made of plastic which is ok as long as you do not put all of your weight on it.
2,Listened to this CD again today and I still can't say enough about how good it is. Gothic and wonderful. The title song Bloodletting gives you the feel of walking with the character of the song through New Orleans. Napolitano has such an amazing voice.
2,"I agree with the others. Anita Stansfield is truly remarkable. The characters in her books share problems and struggles, yet through their faith, the trials end up making each one of them better people. And the readers become better people if they take the lessons to heart. This type of stuff could happen to real people...and through God, blessings are totally possible."
1,"I whish I could do a proper review of this product but since IT WONT EVEN TURN ON, there is not much I can say about its sound and how the keys work. luckily my 7 year old had other presents to entertain herself this christmas. Dont waste your money on this piece of crap."
1,"We put this on our wedding registry and at the time it was $59.00. At that price I assumed it would work very well as it costed more than most hand vacs. I was wrong and I regret not reading the reviews. Shark should have recalled this product. The battery is faulty. I charged overnight then used it to vacuum my car and it faded after 2 minutes. I assumed it just needed more charging time so I charged it for 2 days straight, I brought it to my car to vacuum the seat and it died again in 2 min. We have never been able to use this product successfully. It will take me 2 weeks to vacuum the entire at this rate."
2,"My son received this book as a Christening gift three and a half years ago and now I am ordering a copy for my daughter. The prayers range from traditional (Now I lay me down to sleep...) to original. All are simply worded and perfect for young children to understand. Each prayer is accompanied by a picture that is visually stimulating to the child. I have looked around at other prayer books for children and often find the books do not include the variety that this book offers, or that the prayers are just not as suited for a young child as these are. I will give this book as a baby or Christening gift from now on."
1,"Having enjoyed the original back when it came out, I was keen to see the remake with potentially stunning graphics. I was quite disappointed with the CGI effects. The scorpion battle scenes were murky and claustrophobic. The only bright spot, image-wise, was the Medusa battle; a glimpse of what the whole movie should have looked like. The Kraken - yawn. In summary - stick with the original, or avoid both altogether. Oh yeah, and how do you make Liam Neeson look like an 80's hair band outcast."
2,I got this book for my kids teachers as end of the year gifts- it is very cute! Even as an early childhood teacher I can relate to it!
2,"Though I prefer his Live Discs of the 60's&70's better this one is Good.He Does His Covers of TIme after Time,A Perfect Way&Prince's Movie Star which is a Trip out song that Prince had done underground Several Years Back but he finally put it out on his Crystal Ball Set.Miles is Mellow&Spaces Well on these two-Discs."
2,Was good to find this again -- didn't buy it the first time and regretted it as my spouse is a BIG fan of the Duke. It's a nice movie -- the liner notes helped me make a choice between it and several others I'll be ordering later.
1,I purchased this so-called digital audio splitter to allow non-simultaneous audio connection between my Blue-Ray DVD Player and my new 3rd generation Apple TV with my older but high-end Onkyo TX-DS747 Audio Video Control Receiver that unfortunately has only one digital optical input. I have great sound with either connected alone to the Onkyo but have difficulty switching the cables when changing video sources. Too many cables and cabinetry prevent easy access. So I hoped with reservations (due to the significant poor reviews) that maybe I would be lucky and this splitter would solve my selection problem. It just doesn't work. No sound from either source. This wan't a costly mistake but a disappointing result and waste of time. I've now purchased an optical to digital coaxial cable to use in one of several digital coaxial ports available and hope this will solve the problem.New - Toslink Digital Audio Splitter Black - 27027
2,"This toner is perfect for the Florida climate. It does not dry out my skin, and is light. I actually use it as moisturizer as well many days."
1,YOU CAN NOT ARTICULATE THE LEGGS FOR DIFFERANT POSES. The figure looks good but you want to be able to do more with it.
2,"I'm just terrible at learning foreign languages. This CD set lets you go at your own pace, but you must be the type who learns well from rote memorization. I'm much better in a classroom, so while this system is helpful, it does not do as much for me as face-to-face schooling/tutoring does.The four stars is for the quality of the product - don't let my admission of how bad I am at learning dissuade you."
2,"If you're buying this, it means you own a PUR water pitcher of some kind and don't have much choice about your filter purchase. Same here. But these make great tasting water, last fairly long, and are relatively inexpensive. I only gave it 4 stars, because I just can't get excited enough about a water filter to give it 5 stars. I don't have any complaints."
2,"This flat screen TV has value written all over it. The brand name is relatively new so there is a risk for the long term, but at [$$$] on amazon or [$$$] at [another store], this is a winner. Changing channels using the remote takes 1 second, picture quality not as good as Panasonic or Sony. but for price, you can't beat this value."
1,"This album is wack, there is no song here that is lyriclly good and challenges you.All they rap about the same things over and over again. Things like Im a gangsta Im gonna kill ya I am dangerous look out or we'll kill ya. Some beats are ok, but the rappers are unexperinced and have no talent at all(Young Buck). They just rap just to rap without any deeper meaning. There is no song here telling us about the life of these ""gangstas"" and there is no song here that will stand out like WOW. Save your money people and don't buy this album cuz you will be disapointed. 50 was just a phenomenon, now he and his crew is a BIG plot.Invest your money in Jay-Z's Black Album there are some serious good songs there."
1,"The quality is OK, but it is about 2mm shorter than regular 1/4"" plugs, such as one came with my Sony V6 headphones, and another adapter I bought somewhere else. Because of the length is too short sometimes it comes out of the socket by itself!"
1,"Our boys enjoyed building these, but there are definite draw backs in quality.The biggest issue I have with it is that its not really as pictured on the box. I can only presume that was the marketing's target product, but there are several difference from what you end up with. The main differences are in the wings, and the cab area, neither are nearly as realistic as the box implies (see image I've uploaded for what it looks like built).The second issue we have is durability. Presumably Lego has some secret plastic formula that make their stuff work well, but these blocks alternate between requiring force to put together, or spontaneously disassembling themselves. I can only assume heat or elasticity of the plastic is to blame, but it is very frustrating for a young engineer."
1,"This book is sorely in need of a ruthless editor and characters about whom one cares. A sentence like ""Able was Owen in the orchard"" stops a reader in her tracks instead of advancing the flow of the narrative. One has no sense of the setting, it could be anywhere with a few minor changes. If one likes hacking through thickets of dense prose in search of nothing much that matters, try this book."
2,"This book is amazing. I wished I had read this book and learn its secret long ago.It holds the secret to a fabulous life for everyone. It reveals the most important truth about man and his power. Even though it is written in simple terms, unfortunately very few people are ready to understand, believe and use the teachings it brings.It will probably take 50, 100 or 200 years before the truth it reveals is used to educate children and allow every man and woman to evolve in a new specie."
1,"I enjoy almost anything Melanie Griffith is in, but this one was too silly and unbelievable. Her character is supposed to be a smart, tough lawyer but she does everything that would either get a real lawyer disbarred, laughed out of court -- or killed. Beautifully shot, great sets and locations, but everybody is wasted in this dopey script. Nina Foch is a GREAT witchy woman, but I missed John Ritter completely (fooled by the beard)and had to rewind to catch his scene in the very beginning."
2,"This chair was perfect for our family! My daughter is a year old and only 17 pounds, so she barely fits in anything made for her age. When she was six months old she actually fit in this chair (but not the expensive Peg Perego one my mom bought for her house - they have to use pillows to prop my daughter up).I know other reviews have said its hard to clean, but I simply take the cover off and throw it in the washer (at least once every other day). I let it air dry and it looks perfect. Minor wiping cleans the rest.The only problem I have with the chair is that my daughter quickly figured out how to pop off the extra tray covers and flips her food onto the ground. We have to use it without the small covers now.Overall, the color is great and so is its size proportions!Would buy it again and again!"
1,"I'm usually accepting of design and quality problems, depending on price, but the Safco 7121 Value Sorter brings both of these qualities to a new low. I put it together for someone in our office, and felt the need to review it to warn people.The shelves are cardboard. Not ""fiber board,"" unless cardboard falls into that distinction in your mind. It doesn't for me. The plastic pieces that are put on the sides and ends of the shelves are flimsy and offer little strength to the shelves.I recommend this product as a definite ""avoid."""
2,"Many books give you the pieces of the puzzle, but Jacquie Barker's Beginning Java Objects shows you the picture on the box. If you want to learn Java, this is the book you should read first."
1,"The Shorter OED is too Britocentric and does not cover North American English well. If you live in the US or Canada, the Merriam Webster is a much better work.Unlike the OED, specific dates are not given and only date ranges such as E17 (for early 17th century) are provided.The quotations are given haphazardly for some senses but not others and many words have no quotations at all. You might be better off getting the whole OED if you're interested in the history of words.If you already have the fourth or fifth edition, do not bother buying this sixth edition as sadly little has changed. Apparently, Oxford University Press is more interested in churning out editions in order to pad its bottom line but won't make the effort to truly update the dictionary."
1,"A family member gave me this book, knowing that I was a fan of American history and ""what ifs"" of all varieties. I've never been a fan of the ultimately ahistorical Harry Turtledove-style novels, and I was interested in reading some alternative history that was a little more academic in scope. That said, this book was horribly boring. I'm not a light reader - just look at my other reviews - but I couldn't even begin to get into this book. Nothing interested me in the least, and after giving the book a try for less than twenty-four hours, I finally had to just take it back. It is one of only two books I've ever returned - that's how brainsuckingly uninteresting it was."
1,"We ordered this lamp for my Dad for Christmas - ready to love it from the picture. The materials are cheap and the pieces don't even screw together well. I'm somewhat of an ""assemble it yourself"" pro - my entire apartment is Ikea and even I couldn't get this cheap lamp to screw together fully. The threads on the pieces don't match up so that if and when you ""sort of"" screw it together, it isn't tight so the lamp wobbles all over the place! Do yourself a big favor and get a different lamp!"
2,"Despues de ver varios de sus libros en las vitrinas, me decidi por algo corto. Una buena muestra con la que seguramente seguiran otras obras.La Historia narrada es bien compuesta y podria pasar por real. Una entre miles de enfrentamientos, afortunadamente este libro nos lo compone.La lectura es rapida y entretenida. El autor usa un lenguaje sencillo ademas de comico-critico que permite que la obra se haga entretenida.Lo recomiendo para aquellos que les guste breves novelas historicas o simplemente quieran una breve pausa de la lectura formal."
1,"I read the book for this a few months ago. Even though it wasn't the greatest book, it did have a lot of good parts to it. Unfortunately, all of the best parts of the book were removed from the film, and replaced with mediocre parts, at best.In the book, there were Elves, Dwarves, Dragons, and a bit of magic. I the movie, there were no Elves, no Dwarves, the Dragon was a flying chicken (i.e. feathers, instead of scales), and the magic was lost.The acting in the movie was poor, and the plot was rather thin. You didn't get a chance to feel for any of the characters, since there was very little in character development.All in all, there isn't really anything that can be done to redeem this movie."
2,This was a big help understanding the basics. i could use the video for review. I only wish this came on DVD.
1,"All 5 stars reviews --- that was the reason I bought this item. But I was terribly disappointed. The timbre was not good, with rigid strings that needed to be replaced. No wax on the surface; hand feeling was not smooth and was just too light in weight.My friend bought a second-hand Fender Guitar with the same price and was way better than this one.Do not buy this one. I totally regret that I bought it. No more than a mass-produced low-quality guitar."
1,I bought two of these and both have the same tracks on both disc 1 and 2. I assume there has been a mistake in the production. Got credit on the frst one and waiting for the credit onn the second one.
2,This book is a good account of the actual events occurred from the futbol players' points of view. I enjoyed the honesty of it.
2,"(15+ years of consistently great music) Look at the year this came out. WAY AHEAD OF IT'S TIME. This album is a perfect album for them as a band, because they really do show how DIVERSE and talented they really are."
2,"This music well expresses ugliness.The word 'psychotic', seems to suit the sound of many of the tracks.There is no denying that most people would dislike the severity of this cd.The chaos is applied, however, with great detail (using chorus as the main, with countless traditional + classical instruments).'Atonal' is the classical term for the absense of key signature - The notes are all over place.The singing is especially akward sounding.The links this music has to Russian folklore are very confusing, but well explained in the (excellent) liner notes.This music's sound though, is like 20th century Russian classical."
1,Its goin down might be the most annoying song I ever heard. This guy is worse than Dem Francise Boyz.
1,"Lots of fun moments for kids who love dinosaurs.BUT -- kids today recognize the outdated, unrealistic-looking dino construction; lots of unnecessary shooting and dying (1 dino dies); a couple plain utterances of the word B*TCH; lots of unnecessary, almost gratuitous naked African natives (female upper body); not to mention so-so acting and script and plot.Only for older kids who absolutely LOVE dinosaurs and *must* see more dinosaur movies."
1,"This gadget is nice ... conceptually. However, in execution, it is flimsy, very difficult to use, the blades are almost impossible to change out, and it is an overall waste of money. It works ok for easy things like carrots and cucumbers, but you could slice those just as easily by hand. On the more difficult items (such as potatoes or other dense vegetables), the slices get jammed in the opening and you end up cutting your fingers fairly frequently. It just isn't worth spending [money] for."
2,"Great acting performance by Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and probably one of Bruce Willis' finest performances. The arrived as described within a a reasonable amount of time that was promised. Great purchase."
1,"This telescope is not very user friendly. Directions are terrible and not detailed. The CD was nothing more than an advertisement for its' products as well as a rehash of its' simpleton directions. Trying to see a star or anything was a disappointing experience. The construction is also sub-par, as the set screw in the end of the telescope tube, where you put the diagonal viewer stripped out within less than a day and no longer holds the magnifying eyepiece in the tube. It is a plastic threaded hole with a steel screw. Save your money and buy not only a more powerful telescope, but a better constructed one."
1,"After reading some great reviews I've decided to give this trike a try and purchased it on Amazon for my 3-year-old. Price was the determining factor. I wanted something my son could play for few years and move on to a full bike, I wasn't looking for the most durable product.The package arrived on time, but items seems to be ""open-box"", as I can see dents on some of the parts, all tires had signs of use as I can see specs of dirt on them. This is the first time I've gotten a ""returned"" item advertised as ""new"" from Amazon. Let's just hope that this experience is one time thing, and will not happen regularly with Amazon.Pro:Amazon's great return policy.Con:Got an open box item (probably with some parts missing)The tires smelled awful.The front wheel is smaller than the advertised picture.The trike is smaller than expected."
2,"I bought this CD for two songs - OVERKILL and SUPERMAN. First, I was disappointed that SUPERMAN was the slow song, when the upbeat version mostly used in the SCRUBS intro was what I had really hoped for. OK, I'm guessing, maybe there isn't really a fast version of this song except for the short piece recorded for the show. But then I knew I'd been cheated when the whole version of OVERKILL wasn't put on the CD! I had taped the episode this was on, and they used a whole verse in the show that was NOT put on the album! I really doubt Colin Hay recorded an extra verse for the show, which means there is a longer acoustic version of OVERKILL floating around out there somewhere. Is there some reason they couldn't put the whole song on this CD? Does anyone know where the full-length version of this song is?"
1,"I find it hilarious that the main selling point for this DVD is what is featured on the extra disc. Why else buy it? The speical edition is available in two other releases that came out in the past 2 years. Well, my dear Star Wars...to think it's come to this. RIP Star Wars."
2,"This book is clear, non-technical, and easy to read and understand. People interested in the subject will find it useful."
2,"I heard this the first time on an album/vinyl, back in the early 70's, it was great then and it was great listening to again on cd. One of the best albums Frank Zappa ever put out. Highly recommended. It's an oldie, but it's still a goodie."
2,"Initially, there is a slight vitamin smell. But, you get used to it and the more you drink, the better it gets. It doesn't totally take your hunger away and i find myself eating something with it, albeit not as much as I would without the drink. It contains lots of protein and many vitamins."
1,"I opened the box to find out that the shovel won't even lock. It just flaps in the wind. Coleman is a great company, but why make an item that has let so many people down. It works great now that I have stick welded the shovel locked open. Coleman sure looses points for this item."
2,"Read this book for a women's book club, one of our better reads. Writer portrays eccentric characters with depth and develops connections with threads of chance and mystery. Ending opens the door for speculation and challenges your assumptions of truth and reality throughout. Left me wanting more. Very fulfilling read."
2,"My 4 year old daughter new the consonant and short vowel sounds and was wanting to learn to read. These books are excellent for beginning reading. They gradually add new words and use a lot of repetition! She loves them and is doing great. I would recommend also purchasing the Leap Frog ""Talking Words Factory"" dvd along with these books! It really taught her how to blend sounds!Bob Books are excellent!"
2,"I gave this machine to my wife for Christmas and it has been a wonderful addition to our kitchen. I only have one minor complaint, in that it only runs steam for 90 seconds before having to prime the pump - which only takes a minute or so - to get steam again.I would wholeheartedly recommend this espresso machine to anyone looking for a good machine at reasonable cost"
2,"This novel is a masterpiece of unexpected plot twists, some which revolt and some which charm the reader. Despite the subject matters that may seem repellent, the narrator keeps the reader's attention and charms the reader through the twists and turns of a truly complex plot. At the beginning, I was unsure of where the narrator was going with the chronicle of two Greeks who came to America; but soon, their story becomes intertwined with Cal's, and everything comes together. By the middle of the book, it is nearly impossible to put down. It is elegantly written and requires the reader's full attention, but the read is totally worth it. Upon finishing the book, I missed the characters, because they had become so real and vital."
1,"This product left some of my hair an awful brassy blonde, transformed some of it into the beautiful white that you seek, and then was kind enough to put large lavender patches in my hair. I wouldn't recommend it at all. It was so mismatched that I had no choice but to ditch my blonde hair, which is now incredibly hard to dye over because of said awful product."
2,"My 5 year old grandson loved the helicopter on watch face, stretchy band makes it easily adjustible. I also like numbers for kids to learn to tell time, versus all the digital watches."
2,"This was a quick read - a boon for those chasing the American Dream. For in the short time it takes to read this book or hear about it from a friend, you learn that what you chase may be right in your heart all along. Many are afraid of what they will find in themselves when the car and the job and the house are taken away. The first step is finding the right priorties and not following the culture. A tough concept but I am thrilled someone finally drew attention to what is ailing our society."
1,"Poor casting, ordinary acting, a few unfortunate creative inclusions... a waste of time, money and celluloid. Some films should not be remade."
1,"Sony has a great reputation, so I thought that when I shelled out tons of money for an MD player it would be worth it. And for a while, it was. It's a great looking model with excellent sound quality. It tends to eat batteries relatively quickly, but since it's rechargeable that's not too much of a problem. What *is* a problem is the quality. After owning mine just over a year, it began skipping frequently and often wouldn't eject first try. The remote also became quirky and would turn on for no reason and drain my batteries. Conveniently, all of these problems started happening soon after my warranty ran out. After about 18 months of use, it died. With no warranty, it was going to cost more to repair than to replace. This is my third experience with Sony CD/MD products, and my last. Each product broke conveniently after the warrantly expired."
1,"If one wants to find out a religion, go to the source. Don't believe what others spoon feed you. If you have questions, read the koran, or ask an ismlamic scholar. I'm not going to ask my barber to examine my x-ray cause i don't trust my doctor am I? You get a second opinion from a doctor. And if islam is so horrible, why is it outgrowing christianity at a 10:1 ratio, even with all these evil books written bashing it? Answer me that question."
2,"Nearly a decade after changing how the world thinks about racquetball, Marty Hogan has teamed up Ed Turner to revolutionize the sport once again. Learning the physical skills needed for success on and off the court is one thing, but somehow Hogan continues to transcend the sport itself. The strategies laid out in this book will help you win on the racquetball court, while also giving you the strategies needed to find peace and balance."
2,The Well Fed Writer is great for every freelance writer- and could help authors as well. It is easy to read and has lots of great information to help the beginner and the pro. If you are a hungry writer- this book hits the spot. ...
1,"i bought this item hoping to transfer the pictures off on my nokia 3650, but alas the thing does not work. do not buy this reader if you have mmc it soes not resd it. windows kept saying that i did not have a 2.0 usb port for it to run off of, which is crap i have four."
2,The first time I picked up this book at a bookstore and started perusing the pages; it was love at first sight. Needless to say I bought it without any ado and devoured the book in no time. Since then I revisit the book whenever I'm in the mood for sheer bliss.Seth brings to poetry a simple charm hitherto not seen. His outstanding wit and intelligence make for compelling reading. 'The Golden Gate' is unique in it's sensitive portrayal of a myriad moods without being overtly judgmental. If not for it's philosophy this book is worth a ton for the sheer pleasure it's sonnets provide.
2,"overall this movie was pretty good. the whole idea, and the acting. i could watch this again and again. it wasn't perfect, a few flaws, like the ending, big one. didn't like it one bit. everything else was pretty much very good. it was creepy, suspensful, the things that you need to scare yourself. sarah, the mother, loses her daughter in a drowning accident, but is constantly hearing her daughters pleas for help. never having found the body, sarah is consumed by madness and is desperately trying to search for her beloved child. she seeks answers in an old legend, which only one rule applies: one of the living for one of the dead. while her husband has come to grips with the loss, she will stop at nothing until she gets some answers, even if she must stay in the dark. i thought this delivered as a whole. nice try. give it props for spooking a bit."
1,I typed in USB headset in the search box and because this one was the cheapest I purchased it. When it finally arrived I found out it was not a usb headset which was never written on the product description. The sound quality is good and the mic quality was horrible.
1,"After being assaulted by these so-called ""premiere"" recordings by American modernists, I was perplexed, stunned, then livid. I would hardly consider myself inclined towards late twentieth century music; but be that as it may, I do have a fairly open mind. Unfortunately, the caustic bombast that profusely blasts from this SONY ""vanity disc"" simply appalled me. Could music this abyssmal actually gain public forum with Ma, Zinman and the Philadelphia Orchestra taking the reins? At its very best, the Danielpour Concerto for Cello is an absolute musical monstrosity--- abrasive and an insult to one's intelligence and sensibilities. Kirchner's tedious Music for Cello and Orchestra is a hectoring compilation of notes; and the Rouse Violoncello Concerto--- abominable and confrontational. I find the lack of insight, imagination and humanity pixilating.[Running time 79:13]"
1,"This is a good toothbrush and you won't have to buy replacements for the 6-10 months. While brushing, it works best to progress slowly from tooth to tooth without trying to brush back and forth or in circles. It definitely does better than regular brushing but my checkups are not better than before I started using the brush. The back teeth and the gumline seemed to be missed more but the main surfaces feel smoother. After 2 years, the battery is not holding charge well anymore and the charge indicator LED lights only dimly. Overall, I would say it is worth it but I want to see if there is something better. I am going to buy a Sonicare."
1,Used it several times and compared to the other brands iv used this tastes nasty in anything. Id never buy it again!
2,"This is one of my favorites--of any genre. I accidentally found it by following a link on Napster Radio, and I've been listening to it almost every day since.The guest appearance by Paul Simon is little more than a curiosity, in this case, but certainly not a distraction. The styles are wide and varied, from Salsa to Mambo to Jazz. The production values are the only thing that lets you know that this album was released in 2007, as the music defies a ""time"" of style.I would recommend this album to any fan of Latin music, whether you are a beginner or have spent many years listening to the genre."
2,Cleans and conditions well and easy to use. Would like it better if provided UV protection. Has quality common to all Leisure Time Products.
1,"No wonder her boy is destined to be an only child. I get only an overwhelming vibe of resentment from this mom whose child cuts in on her writing time and whose friends are only competetive about their children. I pushed myself through it because the ideas are good, but her illustrations lack any positive experiences of her own. The most redeeming parts are those in the shaded boxes contributed by other moms. They include the loving and learning aspects experienced by all new moms which Ms. Glyck doesn't seem to be able to contribute herself."
1,"I never received this item. They say the USPS left a note and held it at the post office, but I cannot find the package. VERY bad. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS VENDOR."
1,"Retelling fairy tales we all grew up with is a sensational idea which has been done extremely well. Just not here! In other books yes, but here unfortunately no. The stories in this book do have one thing in common with the original motive of fairy tales. They will put you to sleep. These are some of the most boring low quality stories ever written. Also avoid the books A Wolf at the Door and Snow White Blood Red edited by Ellen Datlow as they are no better than this.If you do want really good retelling of classic tales rewritten in sensational format buy Once Upon A Crime or Politically Correct Fairy Tales. You will find what you're after in those books."

1,"In the first two sesons of House, he was not only the selfish, agreesive, sarcasticc and arrrogant, super mind doctor but also, a human being with a golden heart that hides beneath all those layers of ugliness. At the same time de series never lost its ironic humor that is, most of the time refreshing and provocative.The third season, is complet disaster. It loses the humor and those tininig little things that keep House an human being and not a monster.I love so intensily the first two season as I hated the 3th. It is a dark, selfish, stupid, and intelectual limited House that crumbles like a blind rinoucerous along the episodes smashing and destroying everybody and everything.It looses al the deep and complex personality of the two first season and becomes a one dimension caracter, a cliché, a simplification, almost a markting slogan. Target to whom? Not to me!"
2,"This a a very nice little book about WW1 airplanes in detail. But the problem is that there are 2 volumes and both are hard to come by. But if you can find them, it tells you a lot about most famous (and less famous) WW1 planes, which you can't find anywhere else. I have both volumes (found 1 via Amazon, the other one elsewhere). Mostly text, with some illustrations and black/white pictures. In the middle you'll find a few pages of colour illustrations.simply put, there isn't much on WW1 airplanes in the form of an encyclopedia type book like you have for more modern airplanes. These books are the only ones I found to cover that gap for WW1. The book could have been done better, but still it's quite good."
1,"We've just returned this waffle iron to the store after using it once for a large batch of waffles. The recipe that we had successfully used for several years turned out soggy with this waffle iron even on the highest setting. The exterior gets hot to touch, and the temperature control dial is very loose. The alarm is loud and annoying. Our cheap waffle iron, which finaly wore our after many years, was much better. We'll go back to that model and save $25."
1,"I'm not even going to finish it, which is rare for me. Cliched, badly paced, poor characterization ... I could go on, but look at the other bad reviews if you want more, I think they all say the same thing. I used to like King a lot back in the The Day, but it's been years since I enjoyed his work."
1,"We bought a 6 year old house with matching Frigidaire Gallery Stainless appliances. So far in the past 4 months, we had to have the freezer repaired, the stove repaired, and now the dishwasher. On a good point, the microwave has worked flawlessly. That should blow up in a week or two.In my experience, Bosch are worth the price, built great and quiet. Not sure about Bosch's customer service because their products don't break so I never had to call."
2,"One of my favorite CDs of ALL TIME, Messy Situationz (Messy's Debut) being my favorite! The first track is a bomb diss on TLC and the rest of the cd is filled w/ bootlegs & old tracks.I got this cd back when it first came out, and there is no way I'd pay what their asking, try friscostreetshow.com or cdbaby.com"
2,"Do not expect great acting, memorable dialog or a complex plot. If that is what you want, get a serious drama and have a great time.If you are looking for fast pace, violent action, evil villains and questionable heroes, this is a good choice. Without going into details, the hero (?) is a cop in New Orleans. He gets involved in a war between criminal and questionable elements.Over the course of 104 minutes, we see some nice backgrounds, explore some troubled personalities and see people get hurt, tortured and killed.This is a good solid action movie that has some excellent moments. The cast is reasonably good and they are professional enough to be believable.While it is not a great movie, it is fun."
1,"I have read all of Eric Jerome Dickey's books and a couple of them, I have re-read twice. So when I saw that he had a new novel out, I rushed to get it. To say I am disappointed would be an understatement. This book is horrible! I can understand the message he might be trying to convey, however, the language and descriptions are too graphic and unnecessary. This novel reads like one of those trashy novels that I would never bend the cover on, and I wish that I had not paid full price for a hardcover edition of this book."
1,"I could hardly understand what these people are saying. The non-representative clips on Amazon are very misleading. I wish I knew better, or I wouldn't have purchased."
1,"I've had this PC for about three weeks and so far its been good and bad.The good part is it is much faster than my old K6 but much slower than my brother's Gateway 2GHz P4. He had it over the other day for some head to head gaming and his screamed at higher settings. Mine cost less though!!! And so far all but the newest games run great. I did notice the new Castle Wolfenstein was a little choppy, but I have so many older games I have been ithcing to play I don't mind. For [more money] I can buy a new video card and play anything I want.The other thing is the noise! This thing is loud! I could hardly hear my brother's P4 but my fan on my Compaq is a persistent loud hum. I have taken to turning on music in the background to drown it out. I called Compaq to see if I needed a new fan and the guy told me it was normal. Funny they didn't mention it in the add!"
2,"This was the film that started the mexican cinema industry worldwide and went on to win prizes , even though it's not an excellent movie: it has the folklore and the songs, also the picaresque along with melodrama. It's a very good print taken from the original negatives, so it's quite a great experience..."

1,"We purchased two of these racks to use at our charity rummage sales. Unfortunately, they were not as sturdy and durable as they claimed to be. We barely had 100 lbs of clothes on the racks and one of them broke during the first use. One of the bars broke off completely. We were very disappointed in this purchase."
1,The book is a joke. The levitation ellusion is ridiculous and may work if you are on a stage with lots of props to draw their attention away from what you are doing.
1,"The Blair Witch Project movie was one of the most exciting, innovative, truly creepy movies ever to be made. In this age of Hollywood slick schlock movies, this movie is refreshing. The soundtrack on the other hand is poor. Except for a couple of tracks, it isn't even a good sample of GOTH music. You are probably best to just enjoy your good memories of the movie--and skip the soundtrack. The soundtrack is just a moneygrab based on the hype of the movie. This soundtrack is about as tuneful as kazoo. If you like dated sounding 80's alternative, then this is the soundtrack for you."
2,"Pure and authentic chanting by Tibetan nuns of ChuchikjallNunnery in Karsha, Zanskar. It is a live recording made insidea one-thousand-year-old temple dedicated to Avalokitesvara.The beautiful and hypnotic voices bring one into a state ofpeaceful upliftment. The occasional sounds of coughing, peoplewalking, etc., actually enhances the listening experience, asone feels like being right there in the temple with the nuns.Anyone interested in Tibetan Buddhism and especially prayerchants by nuns, will enjoy this CD. As there are so fewrecordings by Tibetans nuns (compared to monks), I found itespecially a treat to discover this CD. Interestingly though,on one track #9, there are also male voices (the first 6 minutes,than it changes to all female for the rest of the chant). Thisgives a wonderful opportunity to experience the difference ofsound and harmonies between nuns and monks."
2,"33hz posess the pounding beats and bass of RnB AND the emotion and sincerity of ""indie rock"" (for lack of a better term). I've never heard anything like it. Think somewhere along the lines of combining Prince, Beck and Usher and you'd be pretty close. They have some fun disco tendencies too. This record is sexy, danceable, and fun. I'd really like to see this band live, I bet they put on a killer show. Either way, this record will make you want to dance or have sex...or maybe both."
2,"Stuart McRobert has written a book that applies to the 95% of the bodybuilders out there..those of us called ""hardgainers"". After suffering through years of failure because of reading books by genetically gifted and drug assisted champions, as well as following the instructions of local uninformed personal trainers, my body was battered and broken. After suffering a back and leg injury I was ready to give up. After reading this book and utilizing the sane and wise advice, I have excelled beyond what I had ever expected. If you love weights...buy this book!!!! You will not regret it! I wish I had it years ago."
1,"A mystery I think not! Well written, but the story was too predictable. I knew what was going to happen after the first seventy-five pages. Guterson wrote as if he were a poet, great adjectives and verbs, but he forgot to add mystery to the tale. The book read slow because of this, it took me a lot longer than it should have to read four hundred some pages. The only mystery was; what happened to the mystery in the novel? In first chapters, Guterson pulls you in with exquisite vocabulary, then you are dropped like a bad habit by lack of story. Disappointing to read such a great and yet not so great book in one. I did not suggest this book any of my friends, as I will not suggest it to you. Find a better book."
1,"nothing wrong with this album, it just doesn't hold it's own against ""welcome to my dream"". like a previous review stated, it may be hard to find, but well worth the effort."
1,"I've been a BIG fan of MS keyboards and mice for years now, and the Desktop 7000 is the first huge disappointment. I do love the design and the feel of the keys, but the keyboard is constantly issuing commands from the 'touch sensitive' areas when I don't even touch them (I type 120+ WPM). In addition, the middle mouse button only fires 50% of the time, and the delay in the bluetooth is problematic for anyone who needs precision. On top of that I began having USB stability problems when I started using their USB Bluetooth connector. This is with Vista x64. I've already returned one unit and am having the same problems with another, and will be returning it for a full refund. Rumor has it MS is issuing a recall on certain units of this particular keyboard.Oh, and there's a bug with the IntelliType software that renders the pause/play button for media useless in Vista...Guess it's time to look for something else :("
2,My dog plays with this toy whether it is cold or not. It is also a hit with the granddaughter who can hold and throw it easily for the puppy to chase. The cats love it too. It has a crunching noise when played with.
2,"It was not exactly the product I needed and I did have to modify it somewhat, but it worked fine. If you have the right base I am sure it would be easier to work with."
1,"Finally ! Something we've all been waiting for : A SYSTEM OF LYING TO YOUR HEART AND THE WAY YOU REALLY FEEL. I personally have fallen in love with another man and for someone to tell me that the amazing feeling I had is an 'error', that there is something WRONG with the way I feel, is a joke. A lot of people are afraid of their homosexual feelings & hold them back because of how socially taboo the idea is - a lot of men completely eliminate the possibility of being with another man strictly because of how looked down upon it is by society. Well screw society and the world and wake up to how you really feel. The concept of this book is a joke. Don't waste your time or money on a book that instructs a person to not be themself because they just can't take it. Only a fool could truly depend on the ""rightful"" opinions that society trys to drive into our mind."
2,"I used this movie with a high school class. My students found the movie exciting and entertaining. After listening to the original radio broadcast of War of the Worlds and watching the movie, students wrote a compare and contrast paper. Although the story line was the same, they thought it was interesting the way Hollywood modified the story to fit a movie audience. The special effects were great."
2,"My 5 yr old son received it as a Christmas gift. My son always likes puzzles. He needs some help in the first few times. After that, he memorizes all the locations and did it himself. I think for a 5 yr old, the kid needs to have some patience to put together a 100 piece. The puzzle itself is very well made with beautiful colors. It's fun to play with and pleasant to look at. Recommended."
2,"Great for a lot of Polish cooking - especially stuffed cabbage. Product came very quickley. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because of the shipping price. (a little rediculous) If you live in the states, I would check your local foreign foods store before you dive into this."
1,This book is a riveting tale of suspense and adventure. The ending made me cry. Beautiful!
2,"""Away We Go"" is directed by Sam Mendes and stars John Krasinski (Bert) and Maya Rudolph (Verona). Early in the film we meet Bert's parents (Catherine O'Hara, and Jeff Daniels) who seem anxious to leave for Europe on a two year leave just a month before Verona is to give birth. This sets Bert and Verona off to thinking that maybe they should move somewhere different and start a new life themselves. So off they go, first to Phoenix, then Tucson, and up to Montreal before eventually landing in Miami. This journey takes them on a comical tour of their past as they meet old friends or family members whom they haven't seen for years. But the road trip doesn't end there as no place has yet seemed like home so off they go again.This film has a wonderfully disarming quality about it, and is spiked with a playful sense of humor. Bert and Verona are just two very normal and real people who are trying to find their place in life. Go on a journey with them..."
2,"This is Reba's best greatest hits package because it contains everything from when she was ""real"" country....not any of the garbage she's recording now."
1,"""Enemy of my Enemy"" is the second book in the Spirit Walk series and the fourth book in the Voyager relunch sereis and it seem to get worse. Now Captian Chkotay and his sister are being held by a changling and a changling is in control. But, of course Janeway knows this and she has sent Tom Paris to save Voyager and her crew.I have to say at this point, I am reading any Voyager books from my local library, because I can't see spending money on this books. As I said in my last review, die-hard will love this books, but others may want to skip this books"
1,"While the story of how ""Andele"" was captured and grew up experiencing the unfamiliar Indian life is interesting and somewhat intriguing, the way it is told has too much summary. There is very little dialouge in the chapters so you really do not feel for any of the characters in the story or anything that happens to them. While it is mostly Andele's story, the book sidetracks to talk about other people's lives, so it distracts from the main storyline. It is a quick read which is nice, but is not a typical novel. I can only recommend it to the younger crowd, since it reads like a fictional storytelling."
2,"I recently bought this book to help recallc++ I had taken earlier in my studies. Itis a very good book. Admittedly, it haserrors and the errata links provided in the bookhave changed. If you would like to get the links,go to http://www.richmond.edu/~hubbardthen click on the ""books"" link, then click on theerrata link below the picture of this book."
1,"I can't believe it! I read all of the reviews before purchasing this book and everyone said that it was great for beginners and not so great for experienced users. Well I'm a new user and I'm here to tell you that I'm more than half way into this book and I'm more discouraged than ever. The explaination of content is great, but the CD-ROM is so poor that there is no point in explaining it since 80% of the tutorials don't work. How would you feel if somebody told you how to do something and then gave you the wrong tools to do it? Did they stop to think that if the student has never done anything like this before then having messed up tutorials will only confuse the student more? The other reviews mention CD_ROM problems, but I didn't know they were going to be that bad! The creators of the CD-ROM should be paying me for wasting my time. If I could get my money back, I WOULD!"
1,"I used this company because it had such good reviews, but though my tree game full of dark green leaves they quickly started to fall off. As I took the tree out of the box I noticed a significant amount of leaf-loss, but it was so full of leaves I figured this was normal. Over the next week about 75% of the leaves fell off despite proper watering, humidity, and sun. The company sent me a replacement tree which arrived all but dead. I now believe that both trees experienced shock being transported in the cold weather. I was able to save the first tree they sent me but I would advise agains ordering in the cold weather months or paying for expedited shipping."
2,"Loved it! I loved this movie when I was growing up. This movie was made in the 1950's and the quality was good. Not as perfect as I wished it could be, but because it's so old it was worth buying it. Thanks."
1,"I am a fan of Alan H and had never read the Folding Star. This particular Kindle edition, however, is riddled with typos... Dozens of them. It's annoying, distracting and definitely detracts from the experience. It looks to me like they scanned a printed edition and then didn't correct the mistakes. Would not have bought this if I had know about the condition which runs throughout the book. Shoddy-the writing deserves better!"
2,"I saw this movie when I was 11 years old. It's a wonderful movie. I have seen it many times and I cry everytime I see it. Please print it again for all of us, ""Savannah Lovers""."
2,"This Bible is so cool. It's great for 2 reasons.1. It's the Word Of God, so it's going to be great! 2. It's so easy to understand!I Love this Bible. I use it for my Quiet Times with the Lord every morning! This Bible can change your life! READ IT!!!!"
2,"I was looking for some earphones and a friend told me about these. And wow, he was right. I find them to be very comfortable in the ear and they sound excellent. As far as blocking out the sound they do a good job, while on a plane all I could hear was a slight rumble from the engine. Highly recommended!"
2,"Like one of the other reviewers said, watch LAST DAYS HERE so that you ""get it"". This video is simple in its greatness. It is only a 3 or 4 camera shoot but it is excellent! The video reminds me of a retro 70's concert shoot. Pro but vintage looking, very cool. The sound is top notch. If you want to see a nice PRO current recording of the band, this is it! Now go buy EVERYTHING else they did!"
1,"This is the worst movie ever made. And not in a cheeky way. Bad movies can be fun. This aint one of them. It's just awful in every way. And disappointing. Get Shorty was a home run. They put together another great cast for the sequel; they had another great Elmore Leonard story. Then: the adaptation sucked. The direction blew. The actors phoned it in. And the production team couldn't capture that twinkle imperative to an Elmore Leonard story. Your time's better spent re-reading the book. Or, for that matter, banging your head against the wall."
1,"The book should have current interviews with the current band members - not just highlight on Warren. Okay, yes, he was part of the group from 1986-2001, but the author really should have sat down with the other guys in the group and got their side as well. In addition, there are a lot of things the book leave out. I was expecting a little bit more from this book. This was a huge disappointment. I suppose it's only a good read for someone who is not a die hard fan, so I agree with whoever said that."
1,"I chose this rating because it is not the book I ordered! I replied earlier through the amazon.com/feedback and got no response that it was not the book I ordered and asked what I should do and I got no response from anyone! I ordered the book that is listed above, but I received Bible Study by Books by the same author. I would still like the book listed above. Please advise!"
1,"If I rated each fo these video's as I watched them on T.V. I would most certainly give most of them 5's. maybe a few 4'sStreet Spirit's one of my favorite videos' and that along with Fake Plastic Tree's ( a pretty mediocre video actually) are the song/video's got me into radiohead.The Reason this package gets 2 stars is its just so bare bones. Its a bit of a waste unless your so hard up for something radiohead related. With so Much more video/footage of Radiohead that they could have included, its annoying that something this small would be released. Most of these video's are good for a couple viewings. But there are much better Music DVD packages out there, for around the same cost."
1,"I recieved this pump last month... DEFECTIVE. The head is a piece of plastic junk and is missing a pin (Don't they look before putting it in the box?). When I tried to use anyway, the tires lost 20-30 lbs of air upon disconnect. Easton told me that they would send out a new hose and head but they were on backorder (I WONDER WHY)until 1st week of October. Anyway, I called today and was told that it is still on backorder and they don't know when they will recieve it. They will not send me a replacement pump. I was told to wait indefinitely. TERRIBLE PUMP>>>> TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE>"
2,Must read for all the people out there confused about nutrition and health. Clearly written with ample references and scientific data. The book cuts through the nutrition nonsense out there. Addressed major health problems we are facing.
2,"Girl you music is da bomb,especially Nasty Trick. This song really fit these people down in Helen,Arkansas. People around here be bumping your songs all the time.By: Danielle Robinson"
1,"I gave it 2 stars because it was interesting. The movie is based on the founder of Facebook. It spends ample time showing bar scenes and etc. Its not terrible, but its not a movie you would want to watch with the kids because the characters use all the cuss words, including the F-bomb. I would say it was worse than what I had anticipated."
2,"I'm so glad I take my lunch breaks alone. I snorted, cried (from laughing), and pounded on the outdoor picnic table continuously reading this book. My favorite story has to be Laurie making 'Sims' of her and her husband.....sounds exactly like something I would do, among her other stories. I adore this silly, silly woman!!"
2,"This unit provides the best coffee from home, giving commercial quality by allowing the coffee to be brewed enough to extract the best flavor without over brewing which extracts the ""bitters"" that a constant brewer would do.It not only is versatile in strength of brew, but breaks apart quickly and easily for cleaning all the parts. I will definitely stay with this brand when it comes to expanding or replacing this unit."
1,"This is a surprising piece of work. Tom Wolfe writes most of the book seemingly from the view of the Merry Pranksters. However, his tone seems to become distanced and coldly objective as the book concludes. Ultimatly the reader may (if not deluded into thinking the lifestyle a virtual utopia) see flaws and ultimate failure of the lifestyle. I did not find the Merry Pranksters amusing, free, or admirable. I found much of their behaviour to be mindlessly hedonistic, self-destructive, and generally sheep-like in following the teachings of a raving loon. By the end of the book, I had a throbbing headache. However, I think the problem lies not in the writing of Tom Wolfe (for I enjoyed his other books tremendously) but in the subject matter. In conclusion, I am surprised that the scrambled, self-indulgent mind of Ken Kesey was capable of conceiving such a brilliant book as ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."""
2,"I like reading this book. I like saying ""Ten Nine Eight by Molly Bang"" as we start. What a name the author has, and what a talent for making a simple book so engaging! The illustrations are comforting, with a continuity from page to page that is a nice touch. Also, since the father and daughter are African-American, this book brings a welcome diversity to the home library."
2,"So first I read a common book by lois sachar, and I was like, hey i love this, so I got holes, and I am not a reader who loves every book. Holes is really descriptive with moods. I definitely understand how each character feels, and I recommend it for anyone. I am not a person who loves a book like this, but this book changed my reading picks. I hope you read it!!!"
1,"I was very disappointed with this....I realize it is a 1950 film, however, the sound and picture were off much if not all of the film. Additionally, it wasn't listed as a DVD-R, but is. Wish it had been a better quality production with sound and picture in sync as I really wanted it for my collection."
1,you have to enter a code by pushbuttons . i dont recomend having to remember that in an emergency would suck ..... i sent this back and got a handgun safe that scans your finger and opens...... backup key opener to...... much faster
1,"I bought this controller as well as a San Diego Chargers wireless controller for both my kids for Christmas 06. All my anticipated excitement was soon squashed by the poor design of the battery compartment. It stacks the AAA batteries in a pyramid, 2 on the base with the 3rd on top. The 3rd battery constantly pops out and is very difficult to keep in. The compartment door itself does not stay closed either further aggrevating the situation. It seems those guys down at Mad Catz could design this with a rechargable battery and docking station. They say they redesigned newer controllers without the vibrating feature to save battery power. Should have spent that R&D time redesigning the battery compartment issue. Another issue is that the controller symbols do not light up, and if they did, it would be an added bonus. All and all a great idea, just needs some tweaking..."
1,"This product was sent to me twice and twice I had to send it back because it would not work in my Bluray player. It was marked ""Bluray"" on the packaging but on the DVD itself, it was marked ""HD"" which, I am told, will not play in a Blue-ray player."
2,"I must admit that I had reservations about whether or not I would enjoy this movie. I was pleasantly surprised by its humor and wit, and Wilson and Hudson have a great chemistry together. Some of the exchanges between their characters reminded me of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan movies (of which I am a big fan). I am surprised at how many negative reviews it has received here. While I acknowledge that it is not the greatest film of all-time, it was a very entertaining movie, one I would recommend to any fan of romantic comedies."
1,"I don't think I used it more than 5-6 times in the 5 months I've had it, but now the tape deck spits it out or it'll play 5 seconds then go silent for 5 seconds, then come back in and out. I've since replaced it with another brand and I have not had any issues with it so I know the issue is not with the tape deck. The product is cheap, so you get what you pay for. The new one I have was $30-40 and you can tell just by holding the two it's not as cheaply made."
1,"Not that great, lots of info, most of which I already know. I wish there were more about the symptoms of menopause, which there are, but I needed more information. It's good because it recommends way to get through menopause without taking hormone replacement therapy, which I firmly believe causes breast cancer. But it was padded with pretty basic information that wasn't that innovative."
2,"Cette VHS est un pre bonheur , quelle joie de retrouver GUY WILLIAMS et tous les autres excellents Acteurs pour 1 H 30 d'aventures . Merci Monsieur Disney !!!"
2,"It is exactly what I expected. After looking at several drains, I chose this one and I am extremely pleased with it. I simply wash and dry the tray as it collects water from the dishes...so no problem with rusting. Not only does it function well, it looks great! I am very happy with my purchase."
2,"Thank you so much for getting me the book so quickly. As it turned out I will be buying an additional copy. A friend saw it on my table and loved it so much, with her birthday in a few days (I had no idea what to get her before) I gave her the book :-)Love and Grace"
1,"this was sort of an impulse buy, but it worked amazingly... for the first two months. a few weeks into using it, a rip developed in the protective screen. a few weeks later, halfway through shaving, the screen came clean off. obviously, i can't use it anymore, so im looking for a different, better electric razor."
2,"I use a Farberware Percolator (12-cup superfast fully automatic percolator ... and love it). The stainless steel interior gets extremely grimy with build-up. I borrowed this product from the grandparents to try it. It works okay. Since then, I also tried - and have continued to use dishwasher tabs / detergent. I use ""Finish powerball tabs"". I put a dishwasher tab in the coffee filter basket with a full pot of water and run it. Five minutes later, the slime is floating in the water... pour it out, rinse out the pot with clear water, and the inside is exactly like new! Try it for yourself. I suppose that you could dissolve the tabs and run the solution through other kinds of coffee makers. Cost is less, and it's something you always have on hand."
1,"I purcahced this album after buying such greats like ""JANET"" and ""THE VELVET ROPE"" I was so dissapointed! Where are the catchy songs? Where are those unique vocals?! (...)"
2,"Nancy Van Pelt's Creative Hospitality is a good resource to encourage the entertaining phobic to open their homes to others with confidence. Illustrations are clear and practical, and the ideas presented are adaptable to most of our busy lives. Author obviously a tee-totaler and vegetarian, but people of other persuasions can still make use of her suggestions, based on a family legacy of hospitality. Consider this one of several unpretentious and practical social and etiquette guides to have on your kitchen shelf."
2,I have played the katamari for hours on end. The songs are stuck in my head. This game is addictive. Katamari Damacy is a quirky Japanese video game for playstation. You are the prince and you are given orders to push around a giant sticky ball by the king. the king is condescending and goofy at times. the goal is to make the biggest sticky ball (katamari) as you can in the amount of time given by pushing the ball over objects on the ground and making them stick. That is all. Eventually you can pick up people and islands and even clouds. Once you start you can't stop.
1,i ordered this it took like a month to get to me when it finally did reach i got the wrong thing i ordered a gray wolf in stead i got a black one this sucks balls!!!!!!!!!!!! now the black cant work on what i wanted it to id like a refund!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,"This offers the best of everything, but the printer is horrible. I've had this printer less than a month and two colors are out, and I haven't printed anything but black & white e-mail messages with almost no color. The printer gives good results but the ink seems to evaporate and the cartridges ain't cheap!Everything else works, but Epson printers are problematic. Print heads are in the machine and they fail quickly leaving you with a fax, scanner and a costly repair for a printer.Epson print quality is very good, but the company refuses to address problems that make their printers a throw-away. Buy these components separately and buy another type of printer.This one was a gift and I consider it junk because I now have to replace the entire thing."
2,"Don't really have much to say other than very very nice. Sounds like a miniature home theatre. And for the price, you can't beet it... I give it two thumbs up.."
1,"I really, really didn't like this movie but was compelled to buy it anyway. It's got some nice classical music in the soundtrack, and the physical and technical quality of the DVD is good. So if the physical product is what I'm rating, then I give it high marks. But if it's the movie itself that I'm rating, I'd give it a zero. Overblown, pretentious piffle that masquerades as profundity but is really just a glib exploration of Terrence Malick's inflated ego, copiously illustrated with dinosaurs, Southern violence, and milk clouds."
2,"This pedestal is a great buy if you're looking for space saving simple and elegant accent. Thanks, Robert J. F."
2,"This TV is awesome. The picture is much better than our 61"" Sony. I'd recomment the TV to anyone. One disappointing thing, the ""white glove"" delivery service we were to receive NEVER happened. They dropped the TV off at our basement door and never brought it into the room we wanted it or unpacked it or took any packaging with them. I'm very glad that wasn't an extra cost service."
1,"Verrier focuses on the biological tie between child and birthmother to a positively mystical extent, making some very dubious and scientifically-unsupported claims in the process. It's certainly vital to raise people's awareness that adoption is never problem-free, and that it's impossible (as well as unethical) to try to cut a child off from their past, but to do so through a glorification of some primal pre-natal ""bonding"" is unhelpful to say the least. I found the book woolly, annoying, and at times positively deranged."
1,I'm amazed at all the good reviews on here. I made this yesterday and I think the taste is disgusting. I ended up throwing the rest of the loaf out.
2,"I got this Bible for my Daughter , because she asked for one. This bible is so convient in size, she carries it in her purse and reads it everyday! I plan to order two more., one for my son and one for my other daughter. ""What a wonderful gift"""
2,Grisham paints such perfect descriptions of the times and the people that you feel as if you are there. I was drawn in and felt like I was living among the family. His depiction of the cotton farmers' lives in rural Arkansas is so precise and right on the money. Great reading. I couldn't put it down! A must read for a lazy hot summer afternoon.
1,"I have had the Electrolux Oxygen for about 2 years. It spends more time in the shop than at home.Latest problem: power to the power head cuts out after a minute or two, and does not come back. At the shop they say it works fine for them - I'm guessing they try it for 1 minute. I live in the country and do not have any choice which shop to take it to.I detest this machine. Am considering buying a $40 upright at Walmart - I can go through 10 of them for what the $#%&# Electrolux cost."
2,"I was given this book personally by Hal. I had been trying to make a change in my life and felt stuck. His AUTHENTIC, HONEST, and truly inspiring style attracted me immediately. The world is lacking true connection to each other and especially to themselves. I honestly didn't know much about the book before i hired him as a coach. When he gave me a copy i was floored by his story. After i read chapter 8 i felt SO lucky to have him in my life. His experience in business and in life far transcends his years. Read this book. Hire him to help guide your life! Absolute Tops!"
2,"In a word, I was dedazzled by the snowblinding beauty of this book, the heartache of the heroine, the literary panache...I loved Beautiful Bodies, but this gets under the skin of a scared wife, a threatened actress and explores her psyche with a great deal of insight. Any woman who has been frightened by a man will surely identify...works on two levels, suspenseful and smart."
2,"This is high quality and looks just like a salt water aquarium withoutall the expense & maintenance. We put it on during dinner parties, after work to relax us and sometimes when we are away to keep our cats entertained."
1,They all should have failed that class. Looking for a camp si-fi movie and felt assalted by bad script and acting.
1,"First of all, my son cannot push the tiny buttons himself. Even worse, though, one of the five segments stopped working after only a few months of use. I called the company and they offered to exchange it for me for a mere $15.oo, plus the cost of shipping the defective one to them. Woo hoo. I can buy a new one myself for $14.99. They did not stand behind their product and I will not be purchasing another leapfrog product."
1,"The continually referenced web site says, ""Coming Soon."" This book may be ok for a full time help author but is very time consuming to find information. CSS, DHTML and HTML Help information is scattered all over the book. The index is of little help. I'm sure someone could build HTML Help if they had years to do it as did the projects the author references. The supposed on-line files might help. I feel very ripped off that the author did not follow through on the website and example files."
2,"I listened to both sides of this cassette tape and it really seems to relieve stress by allowing the brain to focus on the various sounds. There are many bird sounds on the tape and I definitely recognized the American Robin's call throughout. This is a blend of other sounds as well, church bells, a babbling brook, cows, crows, sheep and even insects buzzing. I was able to easily imagine myself sitting out in a meadow under a warm sun, smelling the flowers with a good book to read. I would recommend this recording for stress relief for people that enjoy hearing birds twittering. Side two of the tape is more bird sound intense."
2,"I have been calling all my mates up telling them to take a geezer at this true blue release worth it's weight in gold. Keepin' it real Keith Urban has dominated the World Country Music Charts with this near to perfect CD release. To say that all the tracks are excellent is an understatement, what you find here is hit after hit belting out through your speakers for a truly fantastic aural euphoric plunder in bliss experience. Keith is the result of a musical love child between John Mellencamp and Steve Vai, and a little John Taylor bedroom eyes genetics to boot (scoot)."
2,"This book is breezy, charming, informative, and fun to read - and I'm telling all my single girl friends to get it! I was fascinated to learn that Las Vegas and Honolulu tie for the highest number of single men in the US, and that women who don't smoke seem to be at an advantage everywhere. In fact, even guys who do smoke seem to want non-smoking wives and mothers for their kids. Wild concludes that married men live longer, get more promotions at work, have fewer heart attacks and more sex than single guys - and (listen to this!) they're less likely to leave the house with unmatched pants and socks!"
2,"This movie is fun for the entire family. It features one of the greatest ""drug-trip-sequences"" ever captured on film, it has the last performance of the classic movie star, Lon Chaney. You've gotta love any flick that somehow packs bikers, classic monsters, hippies and a blond with a body and cleavage that won't stop all in one movie. I don't know how to exlain it better than this... the acting is bad, the directing is sub standard the effects are complete crap but it's still an excellent flick. duh, go buy it:)"
2,"This is a great source book for the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Being a source book, it provides much information for the working occultist. Besides this, like the other books that I have by Carroll Runyon, it is written in a personal, friendly style and brings the knowledge in the book close to one's being.As I have been working with this book through time, I have foundthat it is also an excellant source book for original magickalknowledge that is hard to find anywhere else."
2,"This deck is really good - it's very beutiful, unlike most other decks it's multicultural (American Indian, India Indian, Egyptian, Europe, etc), and loaded with symbols (Hebrew letters, runes, I Ching) that help a knowledgeable reader to give in-depth and broad readings.The deck is hard to read - especially to people who havent read with cards before or dont know the symbols - without the books, which is why I recommend buying the deck with the books as a set."
1,"I would recommend purchasing this for lightweight jackets or hats and scarves only. Heavier winter jackets will cause it to steer off balance, even fall. I purchased 3 of these and all of them eventually broke after a few months of use. I finally wised up and purchasesd the Modern Style Black Finish Metal Eight Hook Coat Hat Rack off Amazon. I have had this one for a month and it is much sturdier than this one for a comprable price. It also offers more hooks."
1,I tried for like 20 mins to get this thing in. It was so uncomfortable and messy. It shouldn't take that much effort to put something in when a tampon takes 3 seconds. It was uncomfortable to get in and even worse coming out even though I followed the directions and squeezed the thing. Also I put it as high as i could get it (to the point i could barely grab the stem) and it still hurt when I walked. What a waste of money!
2,"This food really is different than the Japanese places- , that i know, you will love it.I can tell the difference in I how feel after every meal. I'm sure after incorporating this book into my diet."
1,"Finding Neverland is one of the most overrated movies of this year, other than the slab of garbage that was 'The Polar Express'. I ususally love Johonny Depp. he was cool in Ed Wood, and POTC. But this movie kinda sucks. Kate Winslet isn't even as hot as she ususally is. The story is stereotypical and contrived. Right from that awful park scene, you know what will happen. Depp's carachter will befriend the kids, then Winslet will die. Go see Ocean's 12 or Meet the Fockkers instead of this. Overrated an' slow."
1,The title says it all. The device kept disconnecting from the wireless network and had to be reset. Then D-Link stopped updating their drivers. Probably not going to go with D-Link in the future.
1,"I was quite excited to get this book, but when I looked through it I found that it was very wordy and not so big on substance as far as recipes go. Alot of fluff with not much in terms of recipes to try. I dont know- Im not an expert, I am just glad that I only paid 4 bucks for it."
2,"Werner Bartschi - Piano, Alexander van Wijnkoop - Violin, Christine Ragaz - Violin, Henrik Crafoord - Alto, Walter Grimmer - Violoncelle. Originally recorded in 1981. Only released in Germany."
1,"It was bad enough having to look at a cutesy cartoon of a sea captain throughout this book, but then when this same jolly figure was placed alongside details of death - well it just seemed to indicate that whoever pulled this book together just didn't get it. This was an epic tragedy - not some cutesy little fun subject."
1,It took longer to put this together then the crib! The instructions are vague and confusing. Heaven forbid you put a piece the wrong way. You have to practically break it apart to fix it. I hope that it will at least serve its purpose when my baby gets here.
2,"So funny, so clever, so much better than so many other books for kids. I loved the Secret Diary of Adrian mole Aged 13 3/4 when I read it as a kid. I love it even more now that I'm a grown woman and a reading teacher. It's books like these that inspired me to love reading."
1,"...don't waste your time on this case,cheapest thing I've ever seen for such a quality phone. ""Shame,shame,shame,..."" charger is good though...!"
2,"I was looking for a wall mount just to put my LCD up on the wall so I can have more desk space, and this one is perfect. Too many other ones are too fancy and more than what I need. I like this because it hangs almost directly on the wall, so you're not using up valuable real estate. Additionally, it only requires one screw into the wall to set up, which is much better than having to drill multiple holes like with other designs. My initial concern was that it wouldn't be steady, but as it is, it is surprisingly firm and there's no movement at all. Very clever design and perfect for my needs."
2,"I think that this was a wonderful book, not only because you got to see the world from a different perspective but you also get a feeling deep in your heart about how it must feel going through chemotherpy or watching your best friend die. This book gave me a feeling of hope that signifies that maybe you can't as a doctor save everyone, but you can give them a wish, a wish to give them the opportunity to fulfill a dream that they once had, a dream that they though that they would have enough time to complete later. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants' to see a differnt view of the world from a different point of view were someone is very ill."
1,"This book is sOOoOoooOoOoOo boring...I practically fell asleep~!!! Try to avoid reading this book. I had to read it for school and you do not want to know the torture I had to go through reading it. This book is way too predictable and Mafatu is so unrealistic. It was plodding and it only got a little bit interesting at the end. And I can't believe Call it Courage got the John Newbery Medal~!!! That is so not right. Well, anyway, this book is NOT good so don't even bother reading it. It's just a waste of time. I would really give it 0 stars but the lowest is a 1 star so yeah."
1,"From the reviews and buzz, I expected a memoir along the lines of a David Sedaris piece. Instead, this was a sad portrait of a self-absorbed, disturbed psuedo-clan. Lacking in wit, insight or any redeeming characters, it's apparently also dishonest -- not a real memoir, but a piece of fiction loosely based on a few facts, a la ""A Million Little Pieces"". It's simply not worth the effort."
2,"Don't come to it looking to attack Gore, ""lib-burls"" or some other straw man. Gores arguments that the Earth is becoming warmer can be proven by simply keeping a daily record of the temperature. How much is due to the burning of fossil fuel is an open question although, again it can be proven, that CO2 does trap heat & prevent from radiating into space. Due yourself a favor and watch it, you might learn something. No one every died from the truth, but many have died from lies"
1,"A good looking film, but not enough action. Brian Bosworth is good, and he deserves to be a bigger star. If you want to see his best film (5 stars), watch 'Stone Cold'. That film may well be considered his Citizen Kane."
2,"You get what you pay for! While I have no major complaints about the product, the treadmill we have seems to interfere with the wireless headphones. So, while running it's useless, otherwise it works great"
1,"The price is extremely expensive in stores and doesn't last for many pictures. Also, This will be the second time I am going to return because I ordered the wrong inkjets. Very confusing."
2,"Just thought I'd let prospective buyers know that this machine really is a reliable workhorse. I'm frequently amazed by how poorly so many new appliances are constructed. My 20+ year old KitchenAid mixer, my ancient Cuisinart food processor and this bread machine have all been excellent investments.I primarily use the bread machine as a dough maker and sourdough/poolish starter. If I do make bread in the machine it's to take advantage of the timed start feature so that we can wake up to hot cinnamon craisin bread on cold mornings.UPDATE: I gave this breadmaker to a friend who needed it to actually make the bread from start to finish. She uses it weekly. That means this breadmaker has been going strong for 17 years. If ONLY manufacturers would return to making quality products."
1,"I purchased this heart rate monitor and it has been collecting dust on my shelf ever since. It's completely unreliable as it rarely picks up my heartrate for any extended period of time, even after wetting the electrodes. The electrodes are tiny compared with any Polar brand model. Obviously, not much $ and thought when into the monitor's design. The watch is huge and ugly. For this amount of money, you would do much better buying a Polar FS1 which is just about the same price. That's what I did and I am thrilled with the Polar monitor!"
1,"It looks nice, reasonably priced ($20), but is completely worthless for what it's for. Most of the time it fails to measure your weight (returns with the result of ERR). I find that standing completely still for about 7 seconds (approximately the amount of time it takes to give you a reading) helps avoid the dreaded ERR result. Unfortunately, when it does return something, it returns measurements that can vary by as much as 2 pounds for the same person. Maybe I have a defective product or just expecting too much for a $20 scale? YMMV."
2,"Mr Musicant did a marvelous job on detailing the various US military interventions in Latin America over the last century. The details and facts were easy to follow and the characters were most interesting and colorful. The chapters on Nicaragua, Haiti, Cuba and Panama were most informative, detailing the military and economic phases of the interventions. The cast of characters ranged from Teddy Roosevelt, the wiley Charlemagne, Marine general Joe Pendleton, Sandino, legendary Chesty Puller to name but a few. The assaults on Grenada and Panama were most interesting. The book was both enjoyable and well written. Check it out."
1,"This is not a review of the movie but of the blu ray. I have a Samsung player (firmware is the latest version) and when I inserted the disc the bonus pop ups would display regardless of any settings. I have now found the post in the forums entitled ""Blu-ray bonusview problems"" which has a successful workaround. I also had a rough time navigating the menus as the selection color is difficult to be seen so it took a few times to apply the workaround successfully.My issue is that I needed a workaround which I didn't find until I went searching. I've had this issue before with a different disc and it's frustrating to me to have such a terrible out of the box experience. If I was my mom or someone who is used to movies just playing they'd have a terrible time trying to watch the blu ray.Before I knew of the workaround I watched the DVD but it was with a fair bit of frustration and disgust in the product. I paid for blu ray and want blu ray."
2,"I loved this book so much, I started re-reading it immediately. I thought the characters were a hoot and so real. I don't often laugh out loud when reading a book, but I surely did with this one. Having been involved with 5 children/stepchildren's weddings, I found the whole deal really humorous. I thought Woodrow was the best character. Such a great book!!"
1,"I wore and washed these three or four times before they developed a rip between the crotch and thigh which I noticed the last time I took them out of the washing machine. Worst long underwear bottoms I have ever purchased, didn't even last a month. Also they can be very tight and difficult to get on, just getting my feet through was often a struggle though once on they seemed to fit alright. Last time I'll buy these."
1,"I cannot honestly believe that an alarm clock cannot keep accurate time. Isn't that ITS MAIN JOB???? I received this clock as a Christmas gift, and it has not worked at all. I can't rely on this clock...sometimes it is two hours off, sometimes it is ten minutes off. Please do not waste your money on this junk."
1,"Only two members of the original quartet--Terry Ellis and Cindy Herron--remain on this lackluster release by the Oakland hip-hop vocal group En Vogue. The group is now a trio, with the surviving original members joined by Rhonda Bennett. While their first releases, in the 90s, were joyous and sassy, ""Soul Flower"" lacks the immediacy and power of that early work. It would perhaps be unfair to catagorize this record as flat-out bad (truly, it's not), but it is the first En Vogue album that I find somewhat forgettable. New fans should begin instead with the girls' stronger efforts, such asFunky Divas, which is still their all-time classic. Also highly recommended areBorn to Sing, andMasterpiece Theatre, the latter setting hip-hop arrangements and lyrics to instantly-recognizable melodies from classical music. All of these albums are FUN--which is precisely what ""Soul Flower"" tries to be, but isn't."
1,no wonder this book was free. read the first two stories and started the 3rd but was extremely bored and could not read any more. I have been reading true crime stories for 30 years and have read some boring stories but these are by far the most boring. Dont waste your time.
2,"John Fogerty's first solo album turned out to be one of the best buys that I have ever made in my life. Hearing his version of the the classic Webb Pierce song ""I Ain't Never"" is worth the price alone. In fact Fogerty was able to make each of these songs ""his own."" I wish he would do another album like this again."
2,I thought the war of the worlds was an ok book the thing's i didnt like about it was that in alot of parts in the book it dragged on and on like they just kept on running and running from the martians from mar's.Thing's i enjoyed about the book were it was cool about them breathing fire on the people at where the cylinder first fell.I also liked the times when the martians started destroying everything but it dragged on alot.Ialso enjoyed when the army came and tried to shoot down the martians but nothing happend.
2,"Love the book, i'm not a very big vampire fan but steakley brings a great story. The heroes are tormented and afraid but still fight on. they got the backing of the catholic church and god but they'll need more than that to survey great book. buy it and read it you'll not be disapointed."
2,"Product looked great, arrived quickly and the GF loved them. Whats not to like? Would do business with this company again."
2,"Mars Rising is the best documentary I've ever seen about the issues surrounding a future manned mission to Mars. Shatner's voice-over gives it extra credibility.Race to Mars is the most realistic movie ever made in the ""manned mission to Mars"" genre."
1,"Someone made a mistake down at the CD plant and stuck a copy of the original cast album from The Boy From Oz in the jewel box for the new Rufus Wainwright cd. Wait, no, Hugh Jackman can sing better than this. This laughable, self-absorbed, ersatz Broadway piffle *is* the new Rufus Wainwright cd. Quel horrors!"
1,"The garden shears are broke, the clasp that is suppose to keep them closed does not work, was disappointed that this brand would have a defective item."
2,i am arash afrasiabi and i had red this book before i think it is really a good guide for specially industrial designers who want to start their job in this fild so and it can help you to manage your self and your project very well.
2,"Sure I only watched this because it was assigned for English, but I ended up liking it. Most other 15 year-olds don't like Shakespeare, but this is really good! I liked that they had the orignal Shakespearian language. I haven't seen the newer version of Romeo & Juliet, so I can't compare the two. I really recommend this movie to anyone. I sure would watch it again, even if it wasn't mandatory! It's an instant classic, and a must have for anyone. You wil love this movie. My parents love it too, it brings back a lot of memories for them (yes, good ones). All age groups would like this, except maybe ones younger than my age group (mid-teens). You won't regret getting (or at least renting it) so come on people, give this a try! Enjoy!!!!!"
1,"Ken Ham simply did not convince me that Evolution is a lie. If anything, he convinced me of the ignorance some people have about the basic concepts in the modern theory of evolution. In the end he's just trying to play to the fears of people who don't want their faith threatened by accepting Evolution as fact.Which confuses me, when many profoundly religious people have begun to see that Evolution is the ""Much more than the theory"", to paraphase a quote of one famous Christian leader.Again, Ham goes on about how the Bible must be considered 100% factual information. Such factual information says it is somehow possible to fit millions of species onto one giant ark that according to the decriptions in the bible, was far too small to fit them.., and yet still had to cary all the food required for them to live...Hard to call people liars when making those claims I should think."
2,"Lycan has assembled an anthology that should serve as an example to all aspiring anthologists of the future. It probably won't, but Lycan has given us such an example, nonetheless. He gathered the most important writings in a field that is difficult to track and presented them in an order that makes sense and directs the casual reader to the portions that most interest him. Such an order also makes it easy to use the book as a reference, as do the bibliographies."
1,"This old ""classic"" is totally disappointing. I guess cooking in the sixties (when my edition was published), was no better in Maine than it was in the rest of the country. Standish may have been a guru in her day, but her idea of a great lobster salad is simply lobster mixed with mayonnaise, and her other salads were right out of a 1960 church supper in the midwest... which wasn't good. I mean, mashed bananas in strawberry jello was representative of Maine's finest cooks?? C'mon!"
2,This bear was very nice. Every child I gave this to at Christmas just loved it. It is very soft and huggable. The light show is very nice as well. Even better it comes with batteries so it makes a great gift.
1,"I'm extremely dissappointed with this program. It was origionally scheduled to be release Feb 1st, if not earlier. Almost everyone on the internet (review sites) have played this game and have a ton of screen shots. I don't understand what is taking so long to get the game release. It's new scheduled release is in May!"
1,"I dont think so Oaky, go back to GU Oslo, NY or tranceport if you want to hear Paul at his finest. I mean jesus, justin timberlake?!?! No."
1,"The Motorola H500 Bluetooth isn't worth the package it came in! The voice activation is very poor. The volume is very poor. The control buttons are very hard to use, and it's uncomfortable. I wouldn't recomend the H500 to my worst enemy!Motorola H500 Bluetooth Headset for all Bluetooth Enabled Phones - Nickel [Motorola Retail Packaging]"
1,"Well, I thought the book was really great, but the movie? Basically, it sucked. The actors were hot, but even though now they are all pretty good actors, back then they sucked. They could have tried a little harder. The directors and stuff could have made the movie a little closer to the book. I think they should have either put more effort into the movie or else just not have made the movie."
1,"I've had this battery for only about 4 months, and it is no longer charging properly. The battery has been overheating, and my computer might be damaged because of it. These battery is not the same quality as original equipment battery."
2,"There is a reason that a seventh edition of this book has been printed. It is well written and excellent instrucional material. Students of business and marketing would do well to read this text and then save it for future reference.Reviewed by: Adam Platts, Northridge"
2,"I've got the King size version of this and have happily used it for years.I wish the controls had pockets or hooks or clips so you can hang it on the headboard instead of needing a flat surface to rest them on.As others have pointed out, it's a tight fit vertically (around the edges). If I had a pillow-top mattress, this thing wouldn't stay put because the elastic fitting wouldn't get below the mattress.I found that it gets nice and toasty. I'll turn it to 5 (max) a couple of hours before bed, then leave it at 1 or 2 all night long, or 1 on one side and 2 on the other.The extra heat for your feet is a nice bonus.All in all I'm very happy with my unit, and am buying one for a girlfriend for the holidays."
1,"If you're not picky about your images and just want a light-weight, stylish camera, the DSC-T100 is fine. I just upgraded to it from a DSC-W1, which I'd had for years. I was really happy with my old one and thought the update sounded wonderful, but I think my old camera took better shots. With the DSC-T100, I get a lot of noise in every picture, I get chromatic aberrations around even mild highlights and the pictures also have a lot of ""lens bend"" to them. In a word, my pictures look cheap. When I looked at people using the same camera on flickr, I saw a lot of the same issues in their shots. If everything I just wrote sounds like gibberish, you'll probably do fine with this camera, but I'm disappointed that Sony put out such a bad camera."
1,"I bought this thinking it would be like all the other versions of this old text. Nope. It looks like they scanned it using a poor scanner, and they also omitted Keynes' own footnotes. Don't buy this version."
2,"...and I found it in Trimpey's RR. This book is a no-nonsense approach to ending substance addictions FOREVER. I tried AA and it was an abysmal experience for me because I could not accept the Judeo-Christian aspects of the ""program."" Also, I got tired of sitting in smoke filled rooms listening to depressing stories of ""alcoholics in recovery."" After reading this book and understanding the concepts presented by Trimpey, I realized that I am not powerless over anything, expecially a liquid substance that I know is detrimental to my health.I am no longer ""alcoholic,"" thanks to this book. I am an ex-drinker and I will never drink again.If AA is not working for you, THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS. This book is just one of those options.However, if you are in AA, and the program is working for you - that is great. It just didn't work for me."
2,I just got this. It works great. My only trouble was the driver CD did not work. Looking at the CD closely it was surely defective. But I was able to download the drivers from the net with no problems. Would have been 5 stars if I got a good CD.
1,I bought this because my nails were weak and splitting. This jar did absolutely nothing and was a waste of money! Go to Sally's Beauty Supply and get Hoof and Nail Cuticle. Works much better and less expensive - 3.00 for a jar>
2,"I have extremely thick, coarse hair that is medium length. This iron works great on my hair and my friends, who have thing straight hair to thick curly hair. It heats up really fast and curls perfectly! My curls last all day, and i dont even use any product in my hair! I recommend it to everyone!"
2,I purchased this as a gift for a friend over in the UK. This show was not aired over therer and he wanted to see it. He tells me he loves it and is enjoying watching Season One.
1,"I used this as a textbook in a college course on the history of 20th century physics. Kragh may be factual, and he may be a good historian, but he simply is not a good writer. (Even the professor admitted it was a good book to aid in falling asleep.) Emilio Segre offers a more personable view in From X-rays to Quarks, which I found far more valuable."
2,"I bought this item to use as a mild chemical peel, but happily discovered that it works well in controlling new acne breakout."
2,"I have lots and lots of woodworking books. This one rates right up there with the best that have ever been published. The thing that delighted me the most was the explanation of how to create the gooseneck molding, the rosettes and the turned (and pierced) flame finials for the top of highboys or grandfather clocks. I have been searching for that information for years.For the novice woodworker, this book is an eye opener. For the folks with more experience, this book is a treasure."
1,"If movies like these keep coming out, the actors will need tin cups to collect the coins offered by those making comedies. This movie is billed as a ""comedy,"" but perhaps they were using Dante's definition. The movie is flat and is constantly hampered by contrived dialogue and guesses as to what people think is funny. A much better movie about golf is ""Dead Solid Perfect,"" based on the wisdom of golf writer Dan Jenkins, and which Tin Cup borrows/steals from in an insignificant way. Don't rent this...watch a real comedy like The Fortune Cookie or The Odd Couple."
1,"Save your money! Grow the tomato in the ground, or in a pot! This item is annoying: from putting it together (the top doesn't snap on well), to having to build a special hanger to hold such a heavy item, to being hard to water from the top, to the instructions which tell you to get the right fertilizer without being specific about which one. Avoid this one!"
2,"This is, especially for the price, the best sleeve one can buy. I've had one for a few years. Recently my shoulder bag strap broke (heavy bag), fell onto the NYC subway stairs (metal) hard on the corner. The sleeve took the impact, broke a couple zipper teeth, but my $2500. Apple laptop unscathed -- not a scratch -- and has worked perfectly since. Had I not had this sleeve, I think the results would have been entirely otherwise. A great little insurance policy for $20."
2,I LOVED IT!!! Everybod read it!!! The only reason I didn't give it a 10 was that I save those for my fave!
1,"I was very anxious to try out this game since I have a love for RPG's and read great things online about it. I bought this years ago when i was trying to find good RPG's for the Xbox 360 and only Oblivion was around. Although this game was a good concept, I could not get over the horrible dialog. It was not synced up with the characters lips, as well as not being spoken fluently. Very choppy and alien sounding. Also, there were a few other things i could get over with the game play. I could not read any thing from the menu because the type was so small. I tried this for about an hour and gave up. I ended up trading it for store credit at Game Stop."
1,We Liked the swaddlers. Now that my daughter is older we needed protection and switched to huggies snug and dry.
2,"the product is as mentioned. The product also not only came in on time, but it came in on the 2nd earliest arival date! That is pretty darn cool :)"
2,"John Berger is one of the best unknown writers on the planet. This book shows him in his element, writing about France and Italy in a way only he can. As with the characters he creates and lovingly describes, it is the journey of reading the book -- and not the plot's end itself -- that gives one pleasure. He is so sure-footed with his descriptions that you can sit there and roll the images he has created around in your mind. He brings a tenderness and wisdom to the story that, as with previous novels of his, make it feel less than just ""a story"" but rather something timeless like a fable or myth passed down for generations."
1,"My phone rang just as I was putting this movie into the player. I told my sister what I was about to watch and I have to admit... SHE WARNED ME!!! How could a movie with such a great cast of comedians be so boring and NOT funny??? I kept watching in hopes that it would pick up the pace and get better. It did not. What a let-down. The ""jokes"" were immature and often crude. Apparently, the cast of 40-something year old men still thinks that ""fart"" jokes and the like are funny."
2,I really enjoyed this book but have to say I disliked the rushed ending. You never find out how the heroine makes her way back to England or know what the hero goes through to try and find her. It just happens. Despite that I have to say that I am willing to read it again. Not her best but DEFINITELY not her worst.
1,"These racks are not 24 inches as advertised. They are only 22 inches. If you are replacing 24 inch racks, these are not the ones to do it with."
2,"I found this wonderful book through my family -- my mother bought it to help cook for my sister, who has Celiac Disease. I do not need to eat gluten free -- but some years ago, I asked for this book for Christmas. There are TONS of amazing recipes in here, many I have made several times (they always turn out fantastic!), and several that I look forward to trying someday knowing that they will be excellent the first time around. I cannot recommend this book highly enough, to both GF eaters and the rest of us."
1,"This cd is horrible! There are only 2 songs that are decent: I don't wanna know and should've known. Every track seems as if they are being sung in one note. This cd does not display his vocal range. The lyrics are extremely typical or commercial. Too many borrowings from others. Hurt no more has weak productions as well as too many acclaimed artists that are featured. Also, Mario needs vocal training! If you want a recommendation for a musician check out Javier! this cd is truly amazing...lyrics are beautiful...cd is crafted beautifully! Showcases vocal range...you will hear absolutely no featured artists! yes he is black."
2,"I Love this Cd it has one of the best Bright Eyes songs ever 'No Lies,Just Love' and i love every song on here. This is a must for Bright Eyes Fans!!!"
2,Thank you for this book. I learned a lot about memory loss and how to possibly prevent it without being overwhelmed with medical phraseology. I look forward to hearing more about the latest research in the cause and cure for Alzheimer's Disease.
2,"I found this to be a very nice family game. All the pieces are quality made so I'm sure they will last a long time. I got a little frustrated with it playing with four people. The more people you play with, the more challenging the game becomes because it makes it all that much more difficult to get your playing piece to the point on the board where you want it. For example: When there are two players, you only have one other person messing up your route; whereas, when you play with four people, you have three other people messing up your route. If you like challenges, you'll love this game. It is very easy to learn how to play and my grandkids age 14 & 7 like it as well."
2,"I first read (and purchased) this book soon after its release and loved it. I had read Coyote Blue and thus thought I knew what to expect from Mr. Moore. This book exceeded my expectations. The situations are riotous, the plotting quick and tight, and the one-liners that can be borrowed from this book are without number. From the proper use of Reddi-Whip (""Can up!"") to the ""Ski Boat"" to the Emperor's ""Safety first!"" this book has become an integral part of my personal mythos. And although I can't say I have ever ""skidded the buzzard,"" the ski boat works just great."
2,"I liked how the characters Almah, Meryetamun, Ramesses and Asetnefret are portrayed. I like the feelings the author gives Almah and Mosis while you are reading from there point of view. I thought the book was very interesting and easy to read. I thought Epilogue was good because you find out what Ramesses was really thinking about Mosis."
1,"This book is well written and underlines the dangers of a society in which the cement of society is so fractured that everyone feels entitled to act without regard to a social norm. However, Mr. Schlesinger is hardly the man to trust on such matters. His standards of proper behavior depend solely on one's political allegiance. He has argued on the one hand that a black man is not entitled to a seat on the Supreme Court because of allegations that the man made a dirty joke (never mind that his accuser had serious credibility problems). Then he turns around and defends Bill Clinton against (much more credible) allegations of rape by arguing that ""gentlemen always lie about sex."" The only problem with multiculturalism is its potential for creating a nation where no one can agree on what is right and what is wrong. Mr. Schlesinger, it seems, cannot even agree on such matters in his own mind."
2,"I have several Thunderstorm CD's and this is one of the better ones. Like everyone else, I do find the bird chirping to be disracting, but it can be ignored. I listen to this one to help fall asleepand it is a good CD. I am always on the lookout for a better one, but this is at the top of the list right now."
2,"I found this book to be pretty helpful with clear concepts and clear explainations. I'm building business software and was able to use most of the concepts right away - especially the section on building web apps. There's a lot of source code that comes with the book, but I found the necessary project files on the publisher's website. Also, some basic .NET and C# knowledge is required as this isn't a beginner's book."
1,"Worked great at first, cooled well and quiet, but that lasted about 5 weeks. Now everyone knows when I plug it in, the noise is awful sounds like an engine revving up. I have taken canned air and sprayed it, doesn't make a difference and yes I use it with the stand, which is another issue. Using the stand is not very stable. It is slippery and my computer shifts on it. I have also had the stand collapse on it twice. Would not recommend this product."
2,"5ive - they're not a boy band, they're a lad band! They are so different from the typically boy bands, the lads of 5ive are edgier, harder, but lovable...they rap, they write their own songs, and they have a say in what they want to do. Sure they do sing ballads, but they are heartfelt and touch you in so many ways. I STRONGLY RECCOMMEND this Cd because it's definatly not a waste of $ and trust me - you'll love it to death."
1,"It sux. Plain and simple. Constant buzzing sound, and would repeatedly skip sides, never allowing a smooth flow of music. Meant to ask for a refund or replacement, but since it was so cheap I just trashed it. See for yourself, it just sux."
2,"OK, it's just a scrub sponge but I find this one to be superior for flexibility and it's long lasting. Don't know why the good ones are pricey, but this one is worth it. The scrubby part works well without taking off the finish on the pan. Sterilizes easily in the microwave without damage, a must for me."
2,"Although I've yet to make anything, the practice swatches I played with come out with perfect stitches. Looking at it I feel like I need to go back to school just to learn how to operate it. Once I truly get started with it, I know I will have fun."
2,"i was very disappointed, i did not know about region a and region b for blu ray.ticked me off a little because it was the first thing i have brought online and it was a gift for my mother, she absolutly loves this movie and it wouldn't play at all because we have an australian region player. as far as i could see from looking it up the australian region release of this movie comes out november 24. i wish the site had of warned me when i was purchasing it and getting it sent to australia that it would not play on australian region players. i'm still giving it 4 four stars because its a classic movie with great fight scene lots of drama and beautiful music and scenery."
1,"These shoes certainly are beautiful, but they aren't very comfortable, at least not for me. When I first tried them on, even though the egg crate foot bed was cushy but my foot just felt smothered and like it couldn't breath. The shoes felt a bit too crowded, and yet the heel was sliding off every time I took a step. I hoped it would go away but it just got worse. By the end of the day my feet were sweating (and thats very unusual for me) the outer sides of my feet both hurt significantly, enough that I knew I would have to return them. I had ordered an 8.5 wide size because I had a sneaking suspicion that they would feel narrower than most shoes, from all the cushioning. And I do have feet that are slightly wider than most. (this was the first pair of Wide shoes I've ever ordered - I wear normal shoes all the time without any discomfort) I bought the open backed soft walk shoes instead and they are much more comfortable no pain at all."
2,"I stumbled upon this release, searching for some Irish music influences...Sinead maybe Irish but this c.d certainly doesn't display it. That's not a bad thing though, because every song on ""No Mermaid"" makes you forget what you were looking for in the first place. She may never become as popular as the other Sinead, you couldn't begin to compare her music to Sinead O'Connor and she probably wouldn't want you to...she stands apart. I can't remember the last time I actually liked a c.d from start to finish, three outstanding tracks being No Mermaid, Don't I Know and Whatever It Takes, the first three songs on the c.d and everything else follows the same groove. Unfortunately there isn't a lot of Sinead Lohan out there, her first c.d ""Who Do You Think I Am"" was never released domestically and upon hearing it, you may never have gotten the same sort of impression anyways...I hardly play it as much as No Mermaid."
2,"Jane Kurtz enriches this Inca folktale with details of pre-Colonial Incan life, creating a book which will find enthusiastic audiences among those choosing books for pleasure and teachers and students studying the Inca, as well. The author's beautiful prose is enhanced by David Frampton's richly hued woodcuts, creating a memorable story of a strong heroine in a lost culture"
2,"The only lipstick I have used for 15 to 20 years, ever since it was sold on QVC shopping network. It used to sell in 10 packs, all different colors. The dark blue and black are my favorites."
1,"I would greatly appreciate being able to cite page numbers for essays, as well as gain access to all footnotes."
2,Fantastic show....laugh a minute with this cast. They portray a very real life view of how the late 20's and early 30's of one's life really can be. So many of these skits are very close to home. Glad CBS kept this show on. Thank you Amazon fro bringing this hit home!
1,"I remember GET SMART with fondness and loved watching it with my dad in the 60's-early 70's, so I guess I was expecting too much from this film and I actually left the theater about 40 mins. in. It just was not funny. It tried hard with the gadgets, and quips from the TV show, but for me it just didn't connect at all. I'm not being critical, just honest."
2,Used this to replace my UPS bat. I was going to buy a new UPS but saw this bat and decided to try it. Now the UPS works great. Only thing is be sure you order the one with the right size connectors.
1,"M-E-S-S. Yup, a MESS. The only good thing was the little girl in the movie...she actually was the only interesting thing going on. The dad who disappeared in the closet had a brief good scene. And I said brief.Don't rent, borrow or steal this one. It isn't worth it"
1,"Looks like I'm the only one here who found the book less then average. As in nothing remarkable, nothing memorable, nothing interesting. Heroine was over enthusiastic, hero over sarcastic. She was too innocent (to a point one can call her stupid) and he had super ego (not in a positive way). The story had interesting premise, but it has been done a thousand and one times, and this version of it was not well executed. I found my self bored and skipped whole sections. As it turns out I didn't miss anything. I read books by Amanda Quick (also known as Jayne Ann Krentz) that I enjoyed, but this was a waste of my time. Skip this early work (1989), of today well known author, because it is that EARLY WORK and definitely NOT her best."
2,"Obviously, this type of book is not for Austen purists, but if you liked the first Berdoll book, you'll love this one, too. The story, once again, is great, and I really liked the new characters she's added and the direction in which she's taken some previous minor players. In fact, I hope her next novel is something original, 'cause I don't think she needs the Jane Austen ""training wheels"" anymore. If you're new to Berdoll's take on Darcy and Elizabeth, don't take it too seriously and you'll have fun!Note to ""REFUND"" review lady, above: Good grief, woman, get thee into therapy! You hated the first Berdoll book (I went back and looked up your review), and still insisted on reading this one - or so you say - just so you could dump on it, too. Obviously, this sort of thing isn't your cup of tea, but it is for other people, so get over it! (Same goes for all the other self-appointed Jane Austen police who lie in wait for all these books. Get a life!)"
2,"Over the years Roxette has created some of the most melodic, catchy, and rockin' pop tunes around. This CD is a genuine gem for not only their fans, but anyone who likes 80's music. The extra tracks are all good, with the acoustic demo of ""I call your name"" being a real standout. The inclusion of ""It must have been love"" helps give this CD some weight, as the only thing lacking from the original album was a bonafide hit. But make no mistake about it, this is pure Roxette, a little unrefined and a little unpolished, but still GREAT!"
2,"I've read this book twice and also saw the author live a few weeks ago in San Francisco. He battled for many years with severe depression, and looked for answers to his life through higher learning before having a complete change of life and finding inner peace and joy through living in the present moment. He encourages the reader to let go of the ego and brain ""noise"" and be in the now, which is how he says he lives. Most all of the ""problems"" we have in life don't directly effect us in the moment, yet we are controlled and tortured by them he says. Tolle also makes the case for healing past pain and suffering through simply being fully here now. Making these changes in our materialistic, image possessed, ego driven society is a challenge indeed, but he would say it's our only way out. This is truly life changing stuff."
1,"I was in London last week and decided to see the exciting musical, Notre Dame de Paris. Let's be honest, this may be the worst large-scale musical in the history of theater. The show is so bad that I had to buy the recording. The lyrics are both abysmal and repetitive, the music is uninteresting, and the performances are way over the top. Everyone should buy this CD because this musical and this recording may be discussed forever in the annals of musical theater disasters. Honestly, this score is so bad, it is actually fun to listen to. "" BELLE, There's a demon inside her who came from HELL. And he turned my eyes from God, and oh, I FELL. "" "" Torn Apart. I am a man divided. Torn Apart. I want two women's love. Two women want my love. I don't know how to cut my heart in two. "" Enjoy!"
1,"My son got this for Christmas. We put batteries in and tried the default 0-0-0 combination which is supposed to open the door so you can program your own combination. Everytime we turned the knob trying to get to zero, we only got about half way when it sounded this buzzing alarm like someone was breaking into it. I wrote an email to the company to see if they have a solution. I will update if we finally get it to work."
1,"This game is the most glitchy game I've ever played. In most games, you say, ""Whoah, look! a glitch"". But in this game if you ever get some amazing stroke of luck you may be able to say,""Yeah! No glitches!"" but that will never happen as every level has a glitch that often times will trap you and not let you finish or the game will actually freeze and you will have to turn it off and start from your last save point. If you get this game, do not expect much, and save OFTEN. But it would be best to save your money and get a good and well planned out game like Star Fox Command, Mario Kart DS, The New Super Mario Bros., or Eragon (Yes, Eragon is actually a GOOD game made from a movie!)."
2,"OK, we went through the guilt and sorrow that was grunge, sat through the pompus britpop wave, even got snotty with indie rock. NOW, it's time to PARTY HARD. This album is making it okay to have fun again. It's not deep by any means. Andrew WK is just opening a door for all of us to come on into his party."
2,I played the demo for this game and it was good. the main person in the game is Tidus (but you can name him any way you want). the battle system is cool. and when you sumon a monster instead for the sumon doing just 1 attack (like FF7) the sumon stays in the battle(the sumon does go away when it dies). but once again the cussing kept me from giving it a 5. the graphics are very good. the miny games (like Blitz ball) are fun but they can get fustrating. over all it's a fun game.
2,Have not been able to read it yet. Ordered large print and got regular print. I am sure it is great.
2,Bought this foal because the little one loves horses. He was so excited to get this toy for his farm set!
2,"Wish I had purchased one of these air filters the first time my Jeep needed one. I deliver a mail route on rural, dusty roads, so I regularly replace my air filters. I was spending at least $20 + tax (depending where I purchased the filter). I had gone through the original + 3 replacements before I got smart and bought this one ""lifetime"" filter. I am already getting better gas mileage (1-2 mpg is significant for me), and the horsepower (especially w/ the A/C running) has drastically increased. Don't think about it any longer, just make the investment - it's only twice the cost of a regular, disposable air filter."
1,"I bought this product to replace an old-but-still-working nose-hair clipper I've had for ages. I have to say that this one doesn't begin to compare with the old one....extremely ineffective, difficult to use, and thoroughly disappointing in every way. You almost have to trap a single hair in the middle of the top of this device, and even then, it takes repeated attempts just to remove a single hair. Worthless."
1,this book [stinks]. i hate it. its a waste of money. i thought i would learn how to do a switch 720 540 flip to a backside noselide down a triple kinked handrail landing in a manual and going over to a trashcan and ollieing it while still in the manual in less that a month and ive been skating scince last week.
2,"Have used these filters for daily coffee for over 4 years, and with our extremely hard water, we feel that the coffee really does taste better when brewed using the filter. We're a bit reluctant to replace every 30 batches, as Mr. Coffee recommends, but do replace every 6-8 weeks."
2,"We used this as leaders to get to know each other at church. It was thought provoking and helpful to see each person's strength and to use it for discussion. Not exactly biblical, but secular, and useful."
1,How can you write a book about the Battle of the Bulge and have no maps. I knew when he said oral history there would be no detailed analysis of the battle.
2,I was looking for an analog scale as my mid-priced digital would give me a different reading every time I stepped on it. This is a nice unit which is consistently accurate.
1,"I have a 2010 Accord and the stock radio pulled in all stations within the Tri-state area even to the north of New Haven. I am not sure if it is the radio, the antenna or if the stock radio sent a signal to increase power or what, but this seems to be the weak link. I have to get at least into Norwalk, CT in order to pick up a Hot 97 when I was able to pick it up with the stock past New Haven! 770 WABC and AM stations, I was able to listen them all the way up in MA! I get AM but with FM I have to literally be right up on the tower! I did notice that the origial connector had some metel on the inside but this piece is lacking it. Maybe this is the problem?"
2,"Let's get something out of the way, right now.This is a terrible (or terribly cynical) idea for a movie. A young, inexperienced, classically-trained, white musician suddenly can play the blues after getting his heart broken by a one-night-stand. Awful and laughable.BUT the music is so good (thank you, Ry Cooder and Steve Vai) and the OTHER lead performance is absolutely brilliant. Joe Seneca is note-on perfect and really, really engaging as old bluesman Willie Brown. Director Walter Hill also gets everything he can out of the script, which has its moments, especially considering the lameness of the concept.Buy it. You'll watch it more than once."
1,"It was a truly good effort in talking about children with special needs, but this book is not well written. The grammar and spelling are not great, and the sentence structure is very childish. In addition, there is not much psychological information in this book. As a counselor, I was hoping that this would be a good memoir, but also that people could learn from this family's experience. Instead, there are glossed over life stories and ""self defined"" ideas of psychiatric disorders. While I'm sure it was written with good intentions, this book was severely disappointing."
1,"I was really disappointed with this product. For one thing, the keyboard does not plug into the computer or interact with the software at all. You can buy the software separately, which I would recommend, because this keyboard is not worth $80.00. It had mid-sized keys which are small. My next complaint is that the software only teaches rhythm and what the notes on the piano are. It does not teach a child how to read sheet music. My daughter (6 yrs old) got through the whole software CD in less than 2 hrs. She still can't read sheet music or play songs. She learned a small amount of music theory, which, I could have taught her for free. Finally, they say there is another CD that is Level 2, which there isn't. I have scoured the internet trying to find the next level and it appears not to have been released. So now I am not sure what to do. Way too expensive at $120.00. Not worth the money."
2,"I remember in 1992 when ""Tori"" released her debut, who knew how long she'd be around. It's good to have her here 12 years later. In that span of time, I believe this is my favorite of hers. It's not the most consistent, but still very strong. Included are three of her most popular songs ""Cornflake Girl"", ""Past The Mission"", and ""God"", which I like the most. However, they're all good, and each have something different to offer the listener. A new fan may just want to get her recent ""Tales Of A Librarian"" collection, but for ""Tori Amos"", I think 1994 was ""A Pretty Good Year""."
1,"Does not fit my 2006 Toyota Highlander Hybrid, despite what Amazon says on their web site. It's more than an inch off in both dimensions, so it's not even close."
1,"I can't believe I fell for it...AGAIN!!King keeps getting my money and I keep feeling like an idiot for reading anything he writes since Bag of Bones (and I wasn't thrilled with that).This latest pathetic attempt was produced obviously to meet some contractual agreement (500 pages!-- a coincidence? I don't think so).When Mr. King was at his best a decade ago there was no one who could touch his skill and originality. Everything he's written since has about the originality of a fried egg sandwich. All of these stories in ""E.E."" have been done to death, by King and others.I've given up hope!Save your money!"
2,"Very nice story, well written and inspirational. Anyone in any line of work can take something important away from Bill's life."
2,"After a large amount of research, we finally bought this tv and are very happy about it. We don't yet actually have HD but the picture is still great...I can't imagine what it'll be like with HD.The only problem on the previous model was that the remote was cheap-looking and made badly. This remote looks very nice, with a metal cover and many nice features.Of course, the signal on regular tv is not top-notch, but that is true on every tv."
2,"this is a pretty good cd. i mean, i love the songs slippin and no love 4 me and some of da other songs are pretty tight, and the omen is not too bad of a song but, featuring marilyn manson in it? c'mon. dmx, your a TIGHT rapper but don't feature people like marilyn manson in your songs."
1,"on this record the verve sound an awful lot like a looser, funkier version of barret-era pink floyd. each of the songs is a little gem save for 'endless life' goes precisely nowhere. the shorter version of the title track on the group's eponymous EP is probably more satisfying, but the other numbers are exciting ('man called sun' is a vast improvement over the studio version)."
2,"I currently use another software program by Atlas Business Solutions called Customer Appointment Manager for our practice and became aware of Ultimate Business Planner through their website. As a CPA, I run into clients who need business plans all the time. I recently purchased QuickBooks Premier 2004 only to discover that Ultimate Business Planner is a ""beefed up"" standalone version of what's included in QuickBooks Premier (Atlas Business Solutions and Intuit must have some sort relationship). I recommend Ultimate Business Planner to all my clients. It's easy to use and does a fantastic job. Since Ultimate Business Planner was chosen by Intuit, I know it has to be the best business plan software on the market."
1,The excessive use of irrelevant 1970s music adds nothing to this interesting adventure story. At times it is nearly impossible to understand the dialogue due to the volume of the music. Most of the music (songs) chosen have absolutely nothing to do with the story and they mainly serve to ruin the experience. The book was many times more interesting.
2,"I've been in love with her books since I first read ""Years"" many, many years ago. When someone asks me who my favorite author is, Lavyrle Spencer is always one of the first names I come up with. The minute I spied her newest book on the shelf I snapped it up. I'm glad to say she didn't disappoint me again. I loved the setting, the characters, everything about the book. What I like best is the way her characters struggle through a variety of ups and downs but always become better people at the end. They change as they learn and grow through their relationships with friends and loved ones. As far as ""feel good"" books go, Lavyrle Spencer is #1"
1,"I do like this coffee maker but the caraffe broke falling into the sink. Now it's $50 for a replacement, a whole new maker is $89. Sad. The old design is much better, lasted many years."
1,"Poorly written, hard to believe, full of wooden characters and bad dialogue - totally terrible! And long-winded terrible at that.Espouses a bizaare theory of economics where just a handful of ""industrialists"" are actually the only important people in the world -as if markets didn't drive economies, as if the supply and demand curves weren't even involved, as if investments and team work and workers didn't have an impact on product development.As a capitalist and someone who loves both good literature and just about anything involving market theory, I was so excited to read this book. Then I read it and I found out two things about Ayn Rand: (1) she can't write, and (2) she also doesn't understand a thing about economics.Read it if you want, but wow, is it bad."
2,A Well Written BookTo me this book is well written. The feeling from this bookcomes out at you. In some parts it seems like my life. The author really pours his soul into this book. Very good reading
2,"THE BATMAN GOTHAM KNIGHT WAS GOOD ONLY FOR THE FACT IS THAT WB STUDIO""S COULD HAVE LEAST MADE ALL THE SHORT MOVIE""S 30MINS EACH. IT MAKES YOU WANT MORE FOR EACH EPISODES. I WAS LEFT UPSET BECAUSE I WANTED LONGER TIME OUT OF EACH OF THE SIX EPISODES. THE BEST WAS EPISODE 6 WITH DEAD SHOT THAT WAS REAL GOOD. I HOPE IN THE LONG RUN EACH DIRECTORS MAKE 2hrs MOVIE""S OUT OF THE NEW BATMAN STYLES. WB STUDIO""S SHOULD USE THIS TO MAKE A NEW BATMAN SEASON ON WB NETWORK. SINCE THE BATMAN CARTOON SEASON IS DONE. IT""S STILL WORTH PICKING UP GET IT."
2,"I am enjoying Downton Abbey immensely. I would have rated this a '5' except the quality of the show on my computer is not great...it jumps and sticks sometimes and that is annoying. Otherwise, I would highly recommend Downton Abbey to anyone who likes historical fiction."
2,"This is an affordable microphone for students, teachers, or musicians. You can't beat the deals on Amazon for recording equipment. I use this microphone with a Sony digital recorder, and the quality is excellent for recording ensembles, groups, lectures, making personal notes, or recording on your computer directly into programs like Audacity. This is a good investment."
2,This is a pretty good book and can be used a couple ways. as a training book to sharpen your skills. As a teaching book if you are teaching others. Also this is a pretty good book to use if you are rusty or have never played in a rated event and want an idea of how good you are playing RIGHT NOW!!! The positions are instructive and the rating scale seems pretty close. I am a master just a bit over 2200 and have shown this book to a lot of my friends who are much weaker. The rating scales give a pretty close estimate of current playing level and will make you better as you progress through the tests. Very well done book. I will probably get a few copies for people I know who play chess and want to get better as gifts.
1,"These brackets are nicely finished and easy to adjust and use. The included straps have a really nice padded surround on the buckle, but the buckle itself is totally unsafe. It feels secure, but very easily releases suddenly even when you hold the cam hard against the strap when tightening. Very inferior to our favorite brand buckle, which has sharper teeth."
1,I ordered this last week and the company told me it was sold out. It was still showing in stock. They tried to sell me a cheaper model for the same price. Now it is still showing there are 5 left. It is false advertising and I will never recommend this company. I always order from Amazon but they should check this company out. Be careful.Panasonic is a great brand. All of my tv's are Panasonic. Can't go wrong with Panasonic
1,"These guys are way too full of themselves. In my opinion, Creed is on the same lowley level as Limp Bizkit. Don't buy this if you're looking for spiritual music, don't buy this if you're looking for hardcore. If you want spiritual buy Bjork. If you want Hardcore, buy Zeke,The Dwarves, or MDC (I also recomend the Back From The Grave series). The only reason you'd buy this is if you're an MTV (yeech) teenybopper who wants to fit in."
1,"The DMB is great. The music is sophisticated and well-played by this tight band. The lyrics have more often than not been utter nonsense. The main problem is that these guys recycle their songs more than any band I've ever seen. How long are their loyal fans going to keep buying the same material? All of this from yet another ""activist"" musician, Dave Matthews. Save the planet? I agree. Save your money and skip another DMB rehash? Absolutely!"
2,"This tool is a must-have for the home baker. It's useful for separating a big lump of dough into portions, scraping up dough from the counter, cleaning up the work area (I just scrape the flour and crumbs off the counter into a small wastebasket), even separating a baked loaf from its pan if it sticks. It fits easily in the hand, is very sturdy, and cleans easily as well. Don't be fooled into thinking that it's flimsy. I've had the same one for years, and it has held up well with much use."
1,"This will POWER OFF a computer with a power factor correcting switching power supply. It isn't returnable, and if you buy it, and it doesn't work, you are out of luck."
2,"First of all this books kicks ass, for any real lakers/shaq fan. What else can I say other than, Phil and Kobe wont get along...again. Kobe is EVIL!"
2,"I have not been sleeping well due to increased noise levels. I used my new headphones for the past couple of nights (with white noise on loop) - and what a difference! That's just what I needed. I purchased the headphones for noise reduction, comfort and price - I am very satisfied!!! I would recommend these and purchase again in the future. I can't speak to the durability yet, but they seem to be made well."
1,I bought 30 of these headphones for a keyboard class in a high school...17 of them are already broken in less than 6 months. Do not waste your money. I now have to purchase a whole new set...and they will not be Coby.
1,Doesn't smell bad but not as good as I thought. Think I ordered the wrong Mont Blanc fragrance. Husband uses it though.
1,"I have been using this unit for about ten months now. The clock runs well but I have already replaced the battery once. It seems that, if the clock is fast, periodically the clock has to pace through the 12 hours to reset. The other comments about this clock not adapting to the time change are absolutely true according to my experience also. In the fall, I had relatively little problem because I set the unit to Central time instead of Eastern until the unit finally corrected for the time change about a month later. Spring time change left me an hour off since the unit has no Atlantic setting. I did get them to send me a return number but, since it would cost me to send it back, I decided that it would not be worth my returning the clock...Caveat emptor!"
1,"It's obvious: ""Obiwanbeeohbee"" is a putz. Stop criticizing the critic! Everyone is entitled to his/her own tastes. Let's face it, these ""citical reviews"" have become nothing more than chat rooms, venues for adoring fans to make fools of themselves with lavish verbose praise. But to take such a vitriolic attitude towards a reviewer who is simply expressing a personal opinion is too close to fascism for my taste. Vent your spleen somewhere else or lighten up. There ARE more important things in the world young man.By the way, I agree with Mr. Delahanty's assessment. The music is forced & disjointed with no identifiable connecting theme. But no one's perfect. I'll bide my time until the next album appears."
2,I've had this grinder close to 1 yr. Nowadays...if a product lasts a year...you're doing good. This grinder is a work horse...I like the safety mechanism...'it won't grind if the hopper is not in the right position.' This feature can save a lot of accidents if you have small kids like I do..who love to press buttons at random. Also...it's sturdy..not too noisy & grinds up a great batch of beans every time. My only complaint with this grinder...& it is minor...is that when you set the grind texture to 'Fine' ...it takes very long to grind & would fill up the hopper if you were attempting to make enough beans for a 10 or 12 cup pot. Since I do so rarely...it's not a huge deal..& I've found that with this particular grinder...the beans grind best with the setting closer to coarse than fine. If I had to buy again..I'd buy this one again...& I'd definitely buy it for a gift as well.
2,This is it boys and girls... If you want Niel Diamond and you don't like the live versions of some songs...then this is the album for you. 40 of his greatest hits including the old version of holy Holy. I really enjoyed this collection. There are a couple that I didn't care for like You lost that lovin feeling with Dolly. And there are a couple songs that I wish would have been included like Headed for the future. But you can't have your cake and eat it too. Right? But for an all inclusive album this is the way to go. It was worth the wait and the price... You won't find this album in your local music store here in the states. So order it from Amazon.com like I did. You won't be disappointed.
